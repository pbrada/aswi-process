    For each iteration, this activity&amp;nbsp;is focused mainly on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Completing the Development Case to get ready for the iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Preparing and, if necessary, customizing the&amp;nbsp;tools to be used within the iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Verifying that the tools have been correctly configured and installed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Preparing a set of project-specific templates and guidelines to support the development of project artifacts in the&#xD;
        iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make sure that all the changes made to the project environment are properly communicated to the project members.&#xD;

    This activity is recommended for any project, although the described tasks may be performed somewhat informally in some&#xD;
    types of projects and may be considered part of the on-going support of the project environment. For more information&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>As the name implies, this activity&amp;nbsp;is performed at the beginning of every iteration.</usageGuidance>
    <purpose>The purpose of this activity is to ensure that the project environment is ready for the upcoming iteration. This includes&#xD;
process and tools.</purpose>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>
    A Process Engineer is responsible for completing the Development Case. It's unusual that one individual can master all
    disciplines of software development, therefore, it's important that the process engineer consults experts, both within
    and outside of the development organization.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The development of project-specific templates and guidelines can be done by several people. There is no need for
    detailed knowledge of the process to develop these project-specific artifacts.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are normally several individuals who act as Tool Specialists. Each individual is then responsible for one tool or
    a group of related tools.

    It is recommended to always spend some time preparing your development environment based on the specific needs of the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Background information about the state of the development organization is often collected prior to project startup and&#xD;
    documented in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Preparing the environment for the project is done during the Inception phase. Any subsequent work done to improve and&#xD;
    complete the prepared environment is described in the activity: Prepare Environment for an Iteration.&#xD;

    Supporting the project environment is an ongoing task to allow the project members to do their job efficiently without&#xD;
    being slowed down due to issues with the development environment. This includes installation of required software,&#xD;
    ensuring that the hardware is functioning properly and that potential network issues are resolved without delays.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project environment needs continuous attention. This means that tasks related to supporting the environment are&#xD;
    performed in every iteration throughout the project, with a peak in late elaboration and early construction, when the&#xD;
    whole project machinery is up and running.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity is required in most project settings.&#xD;
&lt;/p></usageGuidance>
    <purpose>The purpose of this activity is to support the developers in their use of tools and process during an iteration.</purpose>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>
    Support of the environment is carried out by one person or a small team of several people. In large organizations,
    these people are often part of the company's IT department or members of its process group.

    Decide How to Perform the Workflow&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following decisions should be made regarding the Environment discipline's workflow:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide how to perform the workflow by looking at the activities in this workflow. Study the diagram with its &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/guard_condition_E3068D2.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_yJ5m89nmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>guard condition&lt;/a>s and the guidelines. Decide which activities to perform and in&#xD;
        which order.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide what parts of the Environment activities to perform. In general, the artifacts in the Environment discipline&#xD;
        are introduced as they are needed. For example, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_manual_styleguide_2E6E0412.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{07A138D6-9C3B-438D-B7EC-D029998A91E4}&quot;>Manual Styleguide&lt;/a> is developed only if the project will develop&#xD;
        &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_support_material_F6EEF661.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{84C28309-4BB7-4243-8760-1B40C537A175}&quot;>User Support Material&lt;/a>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide when, during the project lifecycle, to introduce each part of the workflow. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_development_process_A6449790.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{345D1811-317B-47EC-AC9D-10E1072A7D68}&quot;>Development Process&lt;/a> is always introduced in the beginning of a&#xD;
        project.&amp;nbsp; Optionally, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_development_case_F4260B3A.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{F071C3D3-7054-457F-8A81-EFA6678CCDE1}&quot;>Development Case&lt;/a> may be used to document the detailed,&#xD;
        project-specific tailoring decisions. A customized &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_concepts/guidances/concepts/delivery_process_CFEBBC78.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_EhgqwO8MEdmKSqa_gSYthg&quot;>Delivery Process&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;may be imported into Rational Portfolio Manager to aid in&#xD;
        assigning work and tracking progress of the project. The other artifacts are introduced when they are needed.&#xD;
