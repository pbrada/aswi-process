&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important for a person playing the Process Engineer role to have an in-depth understanding of the underlying&#xD;
    process definition to be able to make informed choices about its configuration. Ideally, a person playing this role&#xD;
    should have had multiple experiences working on software projects that used RUP as the software development process,&#xD;
    and should understand the various considerations to be made when tailoring RUP to suit the context of a specific&#xD;
    software project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The appropriate skills and knowledge for the Process Engineer role include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        First hand knowledge of the structure of the RUP, and of the supporting tool set for creating customized processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Good communication skills to be able to present the process to the teams and to encourage individual team members&#xD;
        to provide feedback to improve the process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></skills>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Process Engineer role can be assigned in the following ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;div>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Assign the person filling the Project Manager role to the Process Engineer role. This is a common approach for&#xD;
            small teams and for teams where there are no dedicated process engineering resources available.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            For larger organizations, individuals filling this role are often part of a process group that defines&#xD;
            organizational configurations and act as process mentors on projects.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            It is common practice for organizations new to the RUP and iterative development to look for resources outside&#xD;
            the company for filling this role for the first RUP driven projects.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/div></assignmentApproaches>
