    For each Build this work is focused on the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Making as assessment of the stability and testability of the Build&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Gaining an initial understanding-or confirming the expectation-of the development work delivered in the Build&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Making a decision to accept the Build as suitable for use-guided by the evaluation mission-in further testing, or&#xD;
        to conduct further testing against a previous Build.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is also referred to as a smoke test, build verification test, build regression test, sanity check or&#xD;
    acceptance into testing. This work helps to prevent the test resources from being wasted on a futile and fruitless&#xD;
    testing effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is potentially conducted once per Build-note however that it's typical not to test every Build. Once the&#xD;
    Build is determined suitably stable, focus turns to &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/capabilitypatterns/test_and_evaluate_4D17BD6A.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{93B7D625-C83A-4EFB-9772-B88F2EB02CE2}&quot;>Activity: Test and Evaluate&lt;/a>. Where it is determined that the Build is&#xD;
    sufficiently unsuitable to conduct further testing against, Test and Evaluation work typically recommences against a&#xD;
    previous suitable Build.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although somewhat dependent on the size of the development effort, we recommend that you should plan to automate&#xD;
    appropriate aspects of this work. For automated elements of these &quot;smoke&quot; tests, it is typical to have them run&#xD;
    unattended in otherwise &quot;dead-time&quot;, such as during lunch or over night.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that in addition to executing automated &quot;smoke&quot; tests, you should also plan to conduct a minimal set of manual&#xD;
    tests on new or significantly changed software items.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></usageGuidance>

    The work is primarily centered around the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;

    include providing timely results, thoroughness and applying reasonable judgment to assessing the usefulness of the
    Build for further testing.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    It is appropriate to allocate a subset of the test team to perform this work; the other team members ignore the new
    build until it is validated as stable, devoting their efforts instead to either additional tests against the build from
    the previous test cycle, or improving test assets as appropriate.&amp;nbsp; See: &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    As a heuristic for relative resource allocation by phase, typical percentages of test resource use for this activity
    are: Inception - 00%, Elaboration - 05%, Construction - 10% and Transition - 10%. Notice that it is typical for there
    to be no formal Build in the Inception phase.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The sophistication and availability of test automation tools and the necessary prerequisite skills to use them will
    have an impact on the resourcing of this work. Where automation tools are used, much of this work can be performed fast
    and efficiently: without automation significantly more effort is required.

    The objective is to gain an understanding of the constraints and limitations of each technique as it will be applied in&#xD;
    the given project context, and to either:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        find an appropriate implementation solution for each technique&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        find alternative techniques that can be used.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This helps to mitigate the risk of discovering too late in the project lifecycle that the test approach is&#xD;
    unworkable.&lt;br />&#xD;
     For each iteration, this work is focused mainly on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Early verification that the intended test strategy will work and produces results of value&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Establishing the basic infrastructure to enable and support the test strategy&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Obtaining commitment from the development team to develop the software to meet testability requirements necessary&#xD;
        to achieve the test strategy, and to provide continued support for those testability requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Identifying the scope, boundaries, limitations and constraints of each technique&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity starts early in each iteration, as soon as sufficient agreement is reached on the mission for the&#xD;
    iteration, and continues as needed throughout the iteration. More frequently addressed in the earlier phases of&#xD;
    Inception, Elaboration and early Construction, typically tapering off in late Construction and Transition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity is considered optional when the test approach is well known, and its applicability in the current context&#xD;
    is well established.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is somewhat independent of the test cycles, often involving the verification of techniques that will not be&#xD;
    used until subsequent Iterations. This work normally begins after the evaluation mission has been defined for the&#xD;
    current Iteration, although it can begin earlier. In some cases, finding the best implementation approach to a&#xD;
    technique may take multiple Iterations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The test implementation and execution activities that form a part of this work are performed for the purpose of&#xD;
    obtaining demonstrable proof that the techniques being verified can actually work. As such, you should limit your&#xD;
    selection of tests to a small, representative subset; typically focusing on areas with substantial quality risk. You&#xD;
    should try to include a selection of tests that you expect to fail to confirm that the technique will successfully&#xD;
    detect these failures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While failures with the target test items will be identified and these incidents logged accordingly, this focus of this&#xD;
    work is not directly on attempting to identify failures in the target test items as it's main objective. Again, the&#xD;
    objective is to verify that the approach is appropriate (it produces results that complement the Iteration objectives),&#xD;
    is achievable (it can be implemented with given resource constraints), and that it will work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For this work to produce timely results, it is often necessary to make use of incomplete, &quot;unofficial&quot; Builds, or to&#xD;
    perform this work outside of a recognized Test Environment Configuration. Although these are appropriate compromises,&#xD;
    be aware of the constraints, assumptions and risks involved in verifying your approach in under these conditions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the lifecycle progresses through its Phases, the focus of the test effort typically changes. Potentially this&#xD;
    requires new or additional approaches, often requiring the introduction of new types of tests or new techniques to&#xD;
    support the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In situations where the combination of domain, the test environment and other critical aspects of the strategy are&#xD;
    unprecedented, you should allow more time and effort to complete this work. In some cases-especially where automation&#xD;
    is a requirement-it may be more economic to obtain the use of resources with specialized skills that have proven&#xD;
    experience in the unprecedented aspects of the strategy for a limited period of time (such as on contract) to define&#xD;
    and verify the key technical needs of the test strategy.&lt;br />&#xD;

    It is typical for this work to require more resource in iterations from the late Inception to early Construction
    phases, often requiring minimal resource late in the Construction and in the Transition phases. However, be aware that

    Starting typically in Elaboration, this work is generally performed multiple times during an iteration, once per test&#xD;
    cycle based on the availability of a series of Builds that warrant independent testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As noted, this work is typically performed multiple times during an iteration; the actual number of times often&#xD;
    equating to once per Build. Note however that it's typical not to test every Build. Note also that the Build schedule&#xD;
    will often result in this work increasing in frequency during the course of the iteration. The need for additional&#xD;
    cycles is governed by assessing when appropriate breadth and depth of testing is achieved within a test cycle, which is&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    For iterations prior to and including those early in the Construction phase, additional effort is usually required to&#xD;
    address tactical problems encountered for the first time during test implementation and execution. These issues often&#xD;
    detract from the number of actual tests successfully implemented and executed and limit either the breadth or depth of&#xD;

    For each test cycle, this work is focused mainly on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Actively prioritizing the minimal set of necessary tests for the Evaluation Mission&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Advocating the resolution of important issues that have a significant negative impact on the Evaluation Mission&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Advocating appropriate quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identifying regressions in quality introduced between test cycles&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Where appropriate, revising the Evaluation Mission in light of the evaluation findings so as to provide useful&#xD;
        evaluation information to the project team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
    <keyConsiderations>In order to achieve a useful evaluation result, it may mean you need to focus your efforts on helping the project team&#xD;
achieve the Iteration Plan objectives that apply to the current test cycle.</keyConsiderations>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Given that providing focused evaluation feedback and achieving test-cycle closure are the objectives of this work,&#xD;
    ongoing prioritization of the work and strategic management of the test resources is required. Focus continually on&#xD;
    identifying and executing the minimum set of specific tasks to achieve the evaluation mission. Ongoing involvement by&#xD;
    the stakeholders in the test and evaluation effort is critical to ensure the appropriate focus is maintained and,&#xD;
    ultimately, that the work is successful.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Notice that for some iterations it may not be possible to achieve the Evaluation Mission as originally defined. Rather&#xD;
    than simply abandoning the test and evaluation effort, it is important to find an appropriate and agreeable revision of&#xD;
    the original Evaluation Mission based on the current situation, and attempt to provide useful evaluation information to&#xD;
    the stakeholders of the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work typically starts toward the end of each test cycle as suitable breadth and depth is achieved in the testing&#xD;
    effort. For test cycles earlier in the project lifecycle, there is typically less work to be managed, therefore less&#xD;
    effort is required to address this activity. In later iterations-especially those toward the end of the Elaboration&#xD;
    phase and throughout the Construction phase-this work becomes more important and typically requires more focused&#xD;
    effort. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/capabilitypatterns/test_and_evaluate_4D17BD6A.html&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The availability of analysis tools that provide accurate and timely results has an impact on resourcing this work.&#xD;
    Without the use of appropriate tools, this task quickly becomes unmanageable as the test effort progresses and&#xD;
    increasingly more detail needs to be analyzed and assessed manually.&#xD;

    the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/roles/rup_tester,{A719CEAE-35FB-42F6-A076-F501B83E5B85}.html&quot; guid=&quot;{A719CEAE-35FB-42F6-A076-F501B83E5B85}&quot;>Tester&lt;/a>. The most important skills required for this work include
    problem and results analysis, communication and negotiation, as well as the ability to identify and focus on the most
    important items (and avoid being sidetracked by unimportant details).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    As a heuristic for relative resource allocation by phase, typical percentages of test resource use for this activity
    are: Inception - 10%, Elaboration - 00%, Construction - 20% and Transition - 30%.

    To explain the work involved in the Test discipline, the activities and work products are organized into a capability&#xD;
    pattern for the discipline.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each activity represents a high-level goal that needs to be achieved to perform effective testing of the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This capability pattern may require variations based on the specific needs of each iteration and project.&#xD;

    Decide How to Perform the Workflow&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The following decisions should be made regarding the Test discipline's workflow: &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide how to perform the workflow by looking at the activities in this workflow. Study the diagram with its &lt;i>&lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/guard_condition_E3068D2.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_yJ5m89nmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>guard condition&lt;/a>&lt;a href=&quot;#guard_condition&quot; target=&quot;glossary_doc&quot;>s&lt;/a>&lt;/i> and&#xD;
        the guidelines below.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide what parts of the Test activities to perform. One key issue for the Test workflow is to decide what quality&#xD;
        dimensions are interesting for the project in general, and most importantly, for each iteration (see &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/types_of_test_8AB94831.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;1.6037730846300355E-307&quot;>Concept: Types of Test&lt;/a>). Decide what appropriate combinations of types of tests&#xD;
        you should focus on for the current iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
