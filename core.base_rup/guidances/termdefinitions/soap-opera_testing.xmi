  <mainDescription>A technique for defining test scenarios by reasoning about dramatic and exaggerated usage scenarios. Like a soap opera on&#xD;
television, these scenarios reflect &quot;real life&quot;, but are condensed and exaggerated to depict dramatic instances of system&#xD;
use. When defined in collaboration with experienced users, soap operas help to test many functional aspects of a system&#xD;
quickly and-because they are not related directly to either the systems formal specifications, or to the systems&#xD;
features-they have a high rate of success in revealing important yet often unanticipated problems. The definition of this&#xD;
term and the associated technique were developed by Hans Buwalda during his test consultancy experience with customers.</mainDescription>
