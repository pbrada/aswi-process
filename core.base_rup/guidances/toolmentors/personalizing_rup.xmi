    Overview&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Personal Process View or My RUP is the personalization feature of the RUP browser.&amp;nbsp; Process views that provide a&#xD;
    focused, uncluttered look into RUP have been created by your organization and project manager will appear as tabs&#xD;
    within the RUP browser tree control.&amp;nbsp; You can create new tabs containing an even more personally focused view of&#xD;
    the RUP process, tailored to your particular roles, needs and interests.&amp;nbsp; You can even add new elements that&#xD;
    provide value in context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following steps are performed in this tool mentor:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#StepNumber1&quot;>Select a Process View&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#StepNumber2&quot;>Save the Process View as a Personal Process View or My RUP Tab&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#StepNumber3&quot;>Remove Unnecessary Elements from the Tab&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#StepNumber4&quot;>Add Important Elements to the Tab&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#StepNumber5&quot;>Organize the Elements&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#StepNumber6&quot;>Hide Process Views&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;StepNumber1&quot; name=&quot;StepNumber1&quot;>Select a Process View&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A process view is a pre-established, non-editable view of the RUP process configuration that your project manager has&#xD;
    created.&amp;nbsp; The RUP comes with several default role-based views, but your organization or project manager may have&#xD;
    created new ones that are particularly useful to the projects you run, and the style of those projects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To select and review a process view, click on a tab in the tree control in the left-hand panel of the RUP&#xD;
    browser.&amp;nbsp; If your configuration of RUP includes the role-based views, a reasonable starting point is the role view&#xD;
    that best describes your duties on the project&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;StepNumber2&quot; name=&quot;StepNumber2&quot;>Save the Process View as a Personal Process View or My RUP Tab&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having selected a process view to customize, click the save icon on the Personal Process View or My RUP tool bar (it&#xD;
    looks like diskette with a name).&amp;nbsp; Enter a name for the Personal Process View or My RUP tab and click on OK.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    A new Personal Process View or My RUP tab will appear in the tree control, and it will be on top of the other&#xD;
    tabs.&amp;nbsp; Notice, it has a picture of a pencil on it.&amp;nbsp; That indicates that it is a personal, editable view of&#xD;
    the RUP.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you started out with the role view most pertinent to you, you could reasonably save the Personal Process View or My&#xD;
    RUP tab with your own name.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;StepNumber3&quot; name=&quot;StepNumber3&quot;>Remove Unnecessary Elements from the Tab&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The easiest means of creating a customized view of the RUP is to save a process view that has everything you want, then&#xD;
    delete the elements that aren't relevant to you.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select the element, or elements, that you don't want using standard mouse or keyboard controls.&amp;nbsp; Invoke the&#xD;
    right-click pop-up menu and select the 'Delete' option.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The elements are deleted from the view.&amp;nbsp; There is no undo at present, but you can get elements back in two ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You can delete the entire Personal Process View or My RUP using the delete icon on the tree control tool bar (a&#xD;
        trash can naturally)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You can add elements from any of the process view trees.&amp;nbsp; See the next step for instructions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;StepNumber4&quot; name=&quot;StepNumber4&quot;>Add Important Elements to the Tab&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are two types of elements you can add to your existing tree.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first are RUP elements in an existing process view that you'd like to see in your Personal Process View or My&#xD;
    RUP.&amp;nbsp; For example, you might be running a small project where you are both Project Manager and Requirements&#xD;
    Analyst, and you'd like all of those elements in one view.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Click on the 'Add from Default' icon on the tree control tool bar (a tree element with a plus-sign (+) beside&#xD;
    it).&amp;nbsp; This will bring up a free-floating tree control dialog.&amp;nbsp; The selection box lets you choose the process&#xD;
    view to use.&amp;nbsp; You can select one or more elements from the process view and drag them into your Personal Process&#xD;
    View or My RUP tab.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The second are resources from outside of RUP, such as web-sites pertinent to your project, or documents stored on&#xD;
    accessible disks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To add this type of link you have two choices.&amp;nbsp; You can either choose 'Insert New' from the right-click pop-up&#xD;
    menu, or you can click on the 'Add New Node' icon on the tree control tool bar (a tree element with an asterisk).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    They have slightly different behavior: 'Insert New' will add the element as a child of the selected element, while 'Add&#xD;
    New Node' will add the element at the bottom of the tree.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both have the same dialog for defining the element.&amp;nbsp; It includes a place to name the element, the location of the&#xD;
    element and pointers to the icons you'd like used when the element is opened or closed.&amp;nbsp; You can browse for the&#xD;
    location or the icons by clicking on the '...' icon next to these choices, or you can enter the URL.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;StepNumber5&quot; name=&quot;StepNumber5&quot;>Organize the Elements&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After ensuring that you have the right elements in your Personal Process View or My RUP tab, you can organize them to&#xD;
    provide the greatest value to you.&amp;nbsp; You could, for example, put roles that you play all of the time at the top of&#xD;
    the tree control, with occasionally played roles at the bottom.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To move an element or group of elements up or down one place, select them using normal mouse or keyboard controls,&#xD;
    invoke the right-click pop-up menu and choose 'Move up' or 'Move down'.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can also drag an element or group of elements onto another element to make them children of that element.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    This is a good way of keeping information in a Personal Process View or My RUP tab without having it clutter up the&#xD;
    view.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;StepNumber6&quot; name=&quot;StepNumber6&quot;>Hide Process Views&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You have the option of only having one process view visible to reduce clutter further.&amp;nbsp; To do this, select the&#xD;
    process view you would like visible and click on the 'Tree Sets' icon on the tool bar.&amp;nbsp; Only the selected process&#xD;
    view will be visible.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
