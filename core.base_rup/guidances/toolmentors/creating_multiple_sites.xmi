    What does ClearQuest MultiSite do for your company?&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ClearQuest MultiSite&amp;reg; adds a powerful capability to ClearQuest. With MultiSite, developers at different locations can&#xD;
    use the same schema and user database. Each location (site) has a copy (replica) of the database and its respective&#xD;
    schema repository. At any time, a site can propagate the changes made in its particular replica to other sites, by&#xD;
    sending update packets. The update process can be automatic or can be started manually with a command.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conflicting record changes at different sites are prevented by ClearQuest MultiSite's mastership scheme. Most&#xD;
    ClearQuest objects can be mastered by only one replica, and only the users of that replica can modify the record.&#xD;
    MultiSite has facilities you can use to share control of records so that multiple users can work on the same record in&#xD;
    turn.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can use the synchronization tools supplied with ClearQuest MultiSite to send changes among replicas as often as&#xD;
    site connectivity allows. If you have IP connections, you can use MultiSite's shipping mechanism to synchronize&#xD;
    replicas frequently and automatically, giving users at other sites access to the very latest changes made at your site.&#xD;
    If you do not have IP connections, you can choose another synchronization method (for example, electronic mail or ftp)&#xD;
    that's appropriate to your implementation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Do you need ClearQuest MultiSite?&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    ClearQuest also allows you to generate reports using existing queries. A ClearQuest report consists of a query inserted&#xD;
    into a report format created by a third-party tool. A role, such as a manager, creates a report format, then saves the&#xD;
    report format in the ClearQuest Workspace. To generate a report, choose a report format, then specify which query will&#xD;
    have its results inserted into the report format. Reports are stored in the Workspace, and can be run at any time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
