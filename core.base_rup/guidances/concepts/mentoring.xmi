&lt;p>&#xD;
    A mentor is someone who teaches and guides the project teams about what they need and when they need it. Typical ways&#xD;
    of mentoring are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Workshop leader&lt;/b>. Some activities are best performed in a group; for example, finding actors and use cases&#xD;
        during use-case modeling. Throughout such activities, it's valuable to have a modeling leader who is a process&#xD;
        expert. An experienced modeling leader can save a lot of time and effort.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Process expert&lt;/b>. The process expert is an on-site support person for the project. The process expert's task&#xD;
        is to help the developers use the process and model as well as possible. If the process expert detects any problems&#xD;
        due to lack of knowledge among the developers, the process expert is responsible for filling that knowledge gap on&#xD;
        the project team.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Project manager support&lt;/b>. A process expert can help the project manager to plan and steer the project.&#xD;
        Sometimes the project manager has little or no experience about the process in question.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Reviewer&lt;/b>. A cost-effective way to transfer knowledge is to have a process expert review the results of each&#xD;
        phase. A review often reveals any problems the members of the project may have with how they use the process. Of&#xD;
        course, the process reviewer does not replace any of the regular reviewers with their domain and technical&#xD;
        expertise.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several good reasons to have one or several experienced mentors on the project. A mentor can:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Give a project a kick-start.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Drive the project's use of the process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Be a cost-efficient way of transferring knowledge.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good mentor becomes dispensable because the goal is that the project will become independent of the mentor. However,&#xD;
    it is not trivial for a mentor to become indispensable. There is a risk that the project will become too dependent on&#xD;
    the mentor taking care of all problems and difficult tasks, rather than the project team solving them. People on the&#xD;
    project need to be given the responsibility for taking over the mentor's tasks, especially ownership of the&#xD;
    process.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be aware that there is a built-in conflict between the goal that the mentor should become dispensable, and the project&#xD;
    manager's short-term goal of successfully finishing the project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Experience shows that having a mentor is very important to process implementation success. Without a mentor, there is&#xD;
    no process driver and, in many cases, this means that the whole process implementation could fail. This is a common&#xD;
    problem.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However for long-term success, it's important not to rely on an outside mentor. Therefore, you need to plan for&#xD;
    transitioning the mentor's role to people within the organization. Assign someone in the organization to become the&#xD;
    expert and to learn from the mentor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One potential problem is that the mentor becomes a resource on the project and cannot focus on the mentoring tasks.&#xD;
    Therefore, it must be made clear that the mentor only does short assignments, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Supporting the project manager&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reviewing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Leading workshops&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
