    &lt;a id=&quot;Measuring Quality&quot; name=&quot;Measuring Quality&quot;>Measuring Quality&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The measurement of Quality, whether Product or Process, requires the collection and analysis of information, usually&#xD;
    stated in terms of measurements and metrics. Measurements are made primarily to gain control of a project, and&#xD;
    therefore be able to manage it. They are also used to evaluate how close or far we are from the objectives set in the&#xD;
    plan in terms of completion, quality, compliance to requirements, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Metrics are used to attain two goals, knowledge and change (or achievement):&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Knowledge goals&lt;/b>: they are expressed by the use of verbs like evaluate, predict, monitor. You want to better&#xD;
        understand your development process. For example, you may want to assess product quality, obtain data to predict&#xD;
        testing effort, monitor test coverage, or track requirements changes.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Change or achievement goals:&lt;/b> these are expressed by the use of verbs such as increase, reduce, improve, or&#xD;
        achieve. You are usually interested in seeing how things change or improve over time, from an iteration to another,&#xD;
        from a project to another.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Metrics for both goals are used for measuring Process and Product Quality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All metrics require criteria to identify and to determine the degree or level at which of acceptable quality is&#xD;
    attained. The level of acceptable quality is negotiable and variable, and needs to be determined and agreed upon early&#xD;
    in the development lifecycle For example, in the early iterations, a high number of application defects are acceptable,&#xD;
    but not architectural ones. In late iterations, only aesthetic defects are acceptable in the application.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The acceptance criteria may be stated in many ways and may include more than one measure. Common acceptance criteria&#xD;
    may include the following measures:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defect counts and / or trends, such as the number of defects identified, fixed, or that remain open (not fixed).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test coverage, such as the percentage of code, or use cases planned or implemented and executed (by a test). Test&#xD;
        coverage is usually used in conjunction with the defect criteria identified above).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Performance, such as the time required for a specified action (use case, operation, or other event) to occur. This&#xD;
        is criteria is commonly used for Performance testing, Failover and recovery testing, or other tests in which time&#xD;
        criticality is essential.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Compliance. This criteria indicates the degree to which each work product, activity, task, or step must meet an&#xD;
        agreed upon standard or guideline.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Acceptability or satisfaction. This criteria is usually used with subjective measures, such as usability or&#xD;
        aesthetics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stating the requirements in a clear, concise, and testable fashion is only part of achieving product quality. It is&#xD;
    also necessary to identify the measures and criteria that will be used to identify the desired level of quality and&#xD;
    determine if it has been achieved. Measures describe the method used to capture the data used to assess quality, while&#xD;
    criteria defines the level or point at which the product has achieved acceptable (or unacceptable) quality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measuring the product quality of an executable work product is achieved using one or more measurement techniques, such&#xD;
    as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        reviews / walkthroughs&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        inspection&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        execution&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Different metrics are used, dependent upon the nature the quality goal of the measure. For example, in reviews,&#xD;
    walkthroughs, and inspections, the primary goal is to focus on the function and reliability quality dimensions.&#xD;
    Defects, coverage, and compliance are the primary metrics used when these measurement techniques are used. Execution&#xD;
    however, may focus on function, reliability, or performance. Therefore defects, coverage, and performance are the&#xD;
    primary metrics used. Other measures and metrics will vary based upon the nature of the requirement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The measurement of Process Quality is achieved by collecting both knowledge and achievement measures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The degree of adherence to the standards, guidelines, and implementation of an accepted process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Status / state of current process implementation to planned implementation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The quality of the work products created (using product quality measures described above).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measuring process quality is achieved using one or more measurement techniques, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        progress - such as use cases demonstrated or milestones completed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        variance - differences between planned and actual schedules, budgets, staffing requirements, etc.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        product quality measures and metrics (as described in Measuring Product Quality section above)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
