    To provide a basis for understanding the physical distribution of the system across a set of processing nodes, an&#xD;
    architectural view called the &lt;b>deployment view&lt;/b> is used in the Analysis &amp;amp; Design workflow. The deployment view&#xD;
    (one of five views - see below) illustrates the distribution of processing across a set of nodes in the system,&#xD;
    including the physical distribution of processes and threads. The deployment view is refined during each iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    The deployment view shows the physical distribution of processing within the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are four additional views, the &lt;b>Use-Case View&lt;/b> (handled in the Requirements workflow), and the &lt;b>Logical&#xD;
    View&lt;/b>, &lt;b>Process View&lt;/b>, and &lt;b>Implementation View&lt;/b>; these views are handled in the Analysis &amp;amp; Design,&#xD;
    and Implementation workflows.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architectural views are documented in a &lt;b>Software Architecture Document&lt;/b>. You may add different views, such as&#xD;
    a security view, to convey other specific aspects of the software architecture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    So in essence, architectural views can be seen as abstractions or simplifications of the models built, in which you&#xD;
    make important characteristics more visible by leaving the details aside. The architecture is an important means for&#xD;
    increasing the quality of any model built during system development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
