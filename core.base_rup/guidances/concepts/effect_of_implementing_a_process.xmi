    Process changes are difficult and it may take time to see their true effects. It is relatively easy and fast to adopt a&#xD;
    new tool- you install it, read the user's guide, go through an example, and maybe attend a training course. This&#xD;
    transition can last from a few hours to several weeks, however, changing the software development process often means&#xD;
    affecting the fundamental beliefs and values of the individuals involved, changing the way they perceive their work,&#xD;
    and how they perceive its value. It is a cultural change that's almost political or philosophical in nature.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A process change affects the individuals and the organization more deeply than changing technology or tools. It must be&#xD;
    carefully planned and managed. The adopting organization must identify the opportunity and the benefits, convey them&#xD;
    clearly to the interested parties, raise their level of awareness, and then gradually change from the current practice&#xD;
    to a new one. Ivar Jacobson describes this as &quot;reengineering your software engineering process&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following areas must be addressed when implementing a process:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The people and their competencies, skills, motivation, and attitude: everyone needs to be adequately trained and&#xD;
        motivated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The supporting tools: new tools will inevitably replace old ones, requiring customization and integration with the&#xD;
        others&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The software development life cycle model, its dependent organizational structure, underlying activities, and&#xD;
        practices together with the work products that are produced&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The actual description of the software development process&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are other areas in addition to those mentioned above that affect the way people work. For example, the physical&#xD;
    working environment, organizational culture and politics, and the reward structure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to those people inside the software development organization, you must also take into consideration the&#xD;
    people outside of that organization who will be affected by these changes, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Managers, who are responsible for the performance of the software development organization must understand why the&#xD;
        process is being changed and why new tools are being procured. It's important that they understand how, and if,&#xD;
        progress is being made. Any process improvement project must have executive support. Management needs to understand&#xD;
        that a return on the investment is being made in changing the process and also that expectations need to be&#xD;
        carefully managed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customers may need to be informed that the organizational process has changed because it could affect how and when&#xD;
        their input will be addressed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other parts of the software development organization may also be affected. Sometimes changes in one part of the&#xD;
        organization may lead to resistance and skepticism from other parts of the organization. The reason is often that&#xD;
        they don't understand the reasons for the changes. Even if they don't have a direct influence, it may cause&#xD;
        political problems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
