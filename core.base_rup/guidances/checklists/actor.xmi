    <sectionName> Have you found all the actors</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>That is, have you accounted for and modeled all roles in the system's environment? Although you should check this, you&#xD;
cannot be sure until you have found and described all the use cases.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Is each actor involved with at least one use case</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>Remove any actors not mentioned in the use-case descriptions, or any actors without communicates-associations with a use&#xD;
case. However, an actor mentioned in a use-case description is likely to have a communicates-association with that&#xD;
particular use case.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Can you name at least two people who would be able to perform as a particular actor</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>If not, check if the role the actor models is part of another one. If so, you should merge the actor with another actor.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Do any actors play similar roles in relation to the system</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>If so, you should merge them into a single actor. The communicates-associations and use-case descriptions show how the&#xD;
actors and the system interrelate.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Do two actors play the same role in relation to a use case</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>If so, you should use actor-generalizations to model their shared behavior.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Will a particular actor use the system in several (completely different) ways or does he have several (completely different) purposes for using the use case</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>If so, you should probably have more than one actor.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Do the actors have intuitive and descriptive names</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>Can both users and customers understand the names? It is important that actor names correspond to their roles. If not,&#xD;
change them.</sectionDescription>
