&lt;p>&#xD;
    Brainstorming means to spend a short amount of time, say 15 minutes, where everyone in the room is allowed to say&#xD;
    whatever they feel is important to the project. After that, a facilitator leads the group in organizing and&#xD;
    prioritizing the results. Rules for brainstorming are the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Start out by clearly stating the objective of the brainstorming session.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Generate as many ideas as possible.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Let your imagination soar.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do not allow criticism or debate while you are gathering information.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Once information is gathered, mutate and combine ideas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The information gathering is typically very informal. Ideas are expressed to the facilitator, who writes them down on&#xD;
    self-stick notes, and then posts the notes on easel charts. The information is then &quot;pruned,&quot; meaning that similar&#xD;
    ideas are combined and outrageous ideas are eliminated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Other techniques to reduce the amount of self-stick notes are to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have everyone take a simple vote.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Let everyone prioritize each idea by category (for example, critical, important, and nice to have), which have&#xD;
        assigned weights (for example, 3, 2, 1). The sum of the priorities for each idea will tell you its importance in&#xD;
        relation to the other.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some ideas may simply be stored away for a later session if they need more development. The remaining self-stick notes&#xD;
    are then moved around and organized in a way that makes sense.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
