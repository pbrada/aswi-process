    These guidelines describe some things to consider when tailoring the RUP.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a description of the overall process for tailoring the RUP, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    RUP&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For a description of some general best practices related to process tailoring, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Defining the Scope of the Tailoring Effort&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Defining the scope of the tailoring effort is where you identify what you want to change and how you want to change it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On order to define the scope effectively, it is important that you familiarize yourself with RUP.&amp;nbsp; For more&#xD;
    information, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How much of the process you decide to tailor, as well as the level of tailoring you decide to undertake, both depend on&#xD;
    a number of factors. These factors are described in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/process_discriminants_36B1ADD5.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.746702783003723E-305&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Process Discriminants&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This section reviews the constituents of a process that are likely to be modified, customized, added or suppressed as&#xD;
    part of a RUP tailoring effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Disciplines&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
         A software project would rarely skip one of the disciplines, such as Analysis &amp;amp; Design, Implementation, and so&#xD;
        on, completely. In exceptional cases, some disciplines, such as Requirements or Deployment, may have been executed&#xD;
        by other organizations. However, it's more likely that specific workflows within or across disciplines would be&#xD;
        modified.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Work Products&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
         Projects are far more likely to differ by the work products that they have to produce, update, and deliver. At one&#xD;
        extremity of the range, imagine a totally paperless project that electronically maintains only a small number of&#xD;
        work products, is supported by tools such as spreadsheets, design tools, programming tools, and testing tools, and&#xD;
        only delivers software and documentation electronically on disk, CD or over the World-Wide Web. At the other&#xD;
        extreme, there are projects that must produce and maintain a much larger set of printed documents for contractual,&#xD;
        regulatory or organizational reasons. In some cases, complete models can be omitted.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Tasks&lt;/strong>&lt;br />&#xD;
         Tasks are likely to vary for at least two reasons. Tasks that use work products as input and produce, or update,&#xD;
        work products as output are affected by the modification of these work products; in particular, if some work&#xD;
        product, or some element of information in a work product, is no longer necessary, the corresponding steps maybe&#xD;
        suppressed or significantly modified. Tasks are also modified to introduce specific techniques, methods, and tools&#xD;
        that pertain to the specific application domain or development expertise, such as design steps, programming&#xD;
        languages, automatic code generation tools, measurement techniques, and so on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At a more detailed level, other method elements can be modified, added or suppressed:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Roles&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Steps in tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Guidelines and guidance for tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Notations, such as using subsets of the UML or using stereotypes to address some specific need for some, or all,&#xD;
        models&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Checklists for reviews&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Tool support to automate some tasks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Terminology changes, for instance to adapt the process to the organizational context&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In summary, the process engineer must make a wide range of decisions when tailoring the RUP. RUP may have to be&#xD;
    adjusted to take advantage of certain well-established company practices and standards, such as documents, terminology,&#xD;
    and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;br align=&quot;left&quot; />&#xD;
     &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Difficult Configurations&quot; name=&quot;Difficult Configurations&quot;>Difficult&amp;nbsp;Tailoring&lt;/a> Scenarios&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Certain tailoring scenarios are difficult to implement and must be considered very carefully. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Change in process architecture&lt;br />&#xD;
         Wide-ranging repackaging of the tasks into another set of disciplines to match an existing process or organization&#xD;
        may lead to a lot of effort for very little gain. Often, it's more practical to simply establish a mapping to&#xD;
        assess whether all aspects are covered by the RUP. Remember that the disciplines are not phases sequentially&#xD;
        executed-they are containers for tasks, and are executed again and again in each iteration, often concurrently&#xD;
        within one iteration.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Changes in terminology&lt;br />&#xD;
         Although substituting one word for another may sound like a trivial exercise in word processing, such changes must&#xD;
        be considered very carefully. In the domain of software engineering, organizations often use the same word with&#xD;
        slightly different meanings, or different words that mean the same thing. Making isolated changes in the RUP may&#xD;
        lead to a process that is very difficult to understand. One solution is to create a &quot;translation table&quot; for the&#xD;
        terminology that translates between the RUP terminology and the organization's terminology.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples of dangerous words are system, phase, role, activity, task, model, and document.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the process results are captured in a language other than English, the terminology issues are more complex where you&#xD;
    must translate the descriptions of work products, documents, reports, and possibly other parts of the RUP to this other&#xD;
    language.&#xD;
