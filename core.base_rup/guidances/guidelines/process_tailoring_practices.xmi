&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you sort through the many work products, tasks, and roles in the Rational Unified Process (RUP), you may ask&#xD;
    yourself these questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do I need this one?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How do I sort through all of these items to determine which ones I need for my project?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Isn't it obvious that the RUP is only for big projects?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The topic of tailoring addresses all of these questions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A software project's purpose is to produce a product. A good process enables the project to produce a product that&#xD;
    meets the needs of its stakeholders, on time and within budget. For additional information, see artifact: &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_product_3C031195.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{EA194F2E-F395-425E-9447-FE32F222A521}&quot;>Product&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key to a good process is in tailoring it to be as simple as possible,&amp;nbsp;while&amp;nbsp;upholding the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/key_business_driven_development_principles_B4EF3701.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_0_ltcDqYEdqvoMTMKvbIlA&quot;>Key Principles&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The guidelines included here should be considered when tailoring a process. More detailed guidance is provided in &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/tailoring_rup_F8F0EB23.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;6.991505672198195E-305&quot;>Concept: Tailoring RUP&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;BuildAFrameworkFirst&quot; name=&quot;BuildAFrameworkFirst&quot;>Build a Framework First&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A common problem for many projects is that they often focus heavily in one particular area, to the extent that they get&#xD;
    bogged down with the details of that particular area before making sure that they have a good idea of what &quot;key&quot;&#xD;
    elements are involved in the whole process lifecycle of producing a quality product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's usually better to address all key elements of a process in a lightweight manner before focusing heavily on any one&#xD;
    particular problem area.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the framework for a quality software process is in place, a project can effectively focus on a particular area&#xD;
    that has been identified as a major contributor to their problems.&amp;nbsp;This selection is based on identifying and&#xD;
    prioritizing risks to the project, and determining early mitigation strategies for those identified risks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Do not include tasks and work products that cannot be clearly justified&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The well-intentioned project manager or process engineer may have a large wish list of nice-to-have metrics, controls,&#xD;
    reports, and so on. However, tasks and work products cost time and money. Some of these costs, such as daily&#xD;
    interaction with the environment toolset, may or may not be visible, but simply get folded into lower productivity on&#xD;
    standard tasks.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You must distinguish critical process needs from the wish list and determine whether the benefits outweigh the cost.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Shield your developers from the process&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You probably have highly trained staff with valuable skills in designing, implementing, and testing. Don't have them&#xD;
    spend hours each week filling out forms, enhancing documentation, or fighting with unwieldy tools. If these tasks are&#xD;
    required, consider having them done by qualified support staff.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Minimize formal intermediate work products&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The format of intermediate work products-those work products not intended for the final product-is not as important as&#xD;
    the task and thought needed to produce them. It doesn't matter what they look like, or what tools you use to build&#xD;
    them, provided they serve their purpose. As Dwight D. Eisenhower said, &quot;The plan is nothing; the planning is&#xD;
    everything.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One trap that's easy to fall into is formalizing work products far too soon.&amp;nbsp; Early versions of work products&#xD;
    often evolve quickly and remain fluid for some time as different representations while their implications are explored.&#xD;
    Formal documentation can impede this process; you can waste a lot of time polishing a work product that's largely&#xD;
    expendable. Hand-drawn diagrams and simple descriptions on index cards are often sufficient in the early stages of a&#xD;
    work product and, for some projects, may be all that's required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;UseConvenientFormats&quot; name=&quot;UseConvenientFormats&quot;>Use Convenient Formats&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A work product may be tailored so it can be maintained in any form. For example, the Vision document may be captured as&#xD;
    a Web page, the Project Plan may be captured as a Microsoft Project file, and the Risk List may be captured as a &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/tools/rup_requisite_pro_593FD397.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{887DBA0C-5761-494D-862D-5956F1C51BF7}&quot;>Rational RequisitePro&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;requirement type.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Generate when possible&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some projects spend a lot of time populating templates of formal documents by manually cutting and pasting&#xD;
    information.&amp;nbsp;Instead, consider generating required documents from the source, using tools such as &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/tools/rup_soda_9EE3674E.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{B33EEA8F-7819-4C8E-A1D9-8B2E285FD51E}&quot;>Rational SoDA&lt;/a>, or negotiate a simpler way of providing the same&#xD;
    information, such as using &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/tools/rup_rose_classic_20F2524D.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{06FB737B-5D74-4C3B-98F4-36153CFB2E34}&quot;>Rational Rose&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;Publisher to generate a Web-based design model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many cases, you can skip a work product altogether because the information is implicitly provided in the&#xD;
    environment. For example, rather than generate the section of the Requirements Management Plan that lists attributes of&#xD;
    requirements types, you may want to only provide the tailored Rational RequisitePro project with the applicable&#xD;
    requirements types and traceability, and then walk through it with the interested parties. Another example is to&#xD;
    provide a read-only version of the Microsoft Project files to the interested parties, rather than duplicating graphics&#xD;
    into a separate Software Development Plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Use the Web&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A useful work product is one that communicates valuable information.&amp;nbsp; This information should be at the fingertips&#xD;
    of those who need it. Web technology is an excellent mechanism for this purpose. If the requirements, design, and&#xD;
    implementation are available on the Web, there's no need to generate large sets of quickly obsolesced paper&#xD;
    documentation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Use integrated tools&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select tools that fit the process and tailor the process to fit the tools. The desired results are an easy-to-use&#xD;
    process and toolset.&amp;nbsp; Integrated tools generally provide greater consistency, and more informative metrics and&#xD;
    reports than tools that are not integrated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;RevisitTheProcess&quot; name=&quot;RevisitTheProcess&quot;>Regularly Revisit the Process&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Regularly revisit the process to refine and reduce its complexity. If your staff isn't convinced that each step in the&#xD;
    process provides added value for the end product, then the process is probably broken.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Tailor while retaining practices&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The RUP encourages tailoring. However, tailoring is not a license to bypass the process altogether.&amp;nbsp; The&#xD;
    essentials of the RUP are embodied in its practices. Follow the spirit of these practices when tailoring the tasks and&#xD;
    work products to fit your needs.&#xD;
