    The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_software_requirements_specification_934E66F.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{BE8165DC-BAF2-4237-B27D-F2A037023364}&quot;>Software Requirements Specification (SRS)&lt;/a> focuses on the collection&#xD;
    and organization of all requirements surrounding your project. If you have a Requirements Management Plan, you should&#xD;
    consult it to determine the correct location and organization of the requirements. For example, it may be desired to&#xD;
    have a separate SRS to describe the complete software requirements for each &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/types_of_requirements_528C097C.html&quot; guid=&quot;5.360970653483052E-305&quot;>feature&lt;/a>&#xD;
    in a particular release of the product. This may include several &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_usecase_A5D30E62.html&quot; guid=&quot;{B1526BC5-E346-42CB-A08A-3C0D7F382407}&quot;>use&#xD;
    cases&lt;/a> from the system &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_usecase_model_EF15E534.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{9C66F2EC-EDEB-4369-9AFB-04B9E7CBCB8E}&quot;>Use-Case Model&lt;/a>, to describe the functional requirements of this&#xD;
    feature, along with the relevant set of detailed requirements in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_supplementary_specification_F5ACAA22.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{B16C2941-791C-44E6-B353-354109B5C9DE}&quot;>Supplementary Specifications&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Since you might find yourself with several different tools for collecting these requirements, it is important to&#xD;
    realize that the collection of requirements may be found in several different artifacts and tools. For example, you&#xD;
    might find it appropriate to collect textual requirements such as non-functional requirements, Design Constraints, etc,&#xD;
    with a text documenting tool in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_supplementary_specification_F5ACAA22.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{B16C2941-791C-44E6-B353-354109B5C9DE}&quot;>Supplementary Specifications&lt;/a>. On the other hand, you might find it&#xD;
    useful to collect some (or all) of the functional requirements in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_usecase_A5D30E62.html&quot; guid=&quot;{B1526BC5-E346-42CB-A08A-3C0D7F382407}&quot;>use&#xD;
    cases&lt;/a> and you might find it handy to use a tool appropriate to the needs of defining the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_usecase_model_EF15E534.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{9C66F2EC-EDEB-4369-9AFB-04B9E7CBCB8E}&quot;>Use-Case Model&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;A Document or a Package?&quot; name=&quot;A Document or a Package?&quot;>A Document or a Package?&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We find that there is no strong reason to focus on the differences between the tools used. After all, you are&#xD;
    collecting requirements and you really should focus on the efficient collection and organization of the requirements&#xD;
    without regard to the tools at hand. Since we are focused on the requirements and not on the tools, we will assume that&#xD;
    the collection of requirements in the SRS constitutes a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/package_6C588F6C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_yPjjANnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>package&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;of information. The elaboration of the various requirements for the&#xD;
    system is embodied in a package we call the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_software_requirements_specification_934E66F.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{BE8165DC-BAF2-4237-B27D-F2A037023364}&quot;>Software Requirements Specification (SRS)&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;From Vision to SRS&quot; name=&quot;From Vision to SRS&quot;>From Vision to SRS&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The SRS Package is obviously related to the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_vision_2D6D6F1.html&quot; guid=&quot;{417F089F-6636-451A-A8AB-AB4EAC7AC4F1}&quot;>Vision&lt;/a>&#xD;
    document. Indeed, the Vision document serves as the input to the SRS. But the two artifacts serve different needs and&#xD;
    are typically written by different authors. At this stage in the project, the focus of the project moves from the broad&#xD;
    statement of user needs, goals and objectives, target markets and features of the system to the details of how these&#xD;
    features are going to be implemented in the solution.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What we need now is a collection, or package, of artifacts that describes the complete external behavior of the system&#xD;
    - i.e., a package that says specifically, &quot;Here is what the system has to do to deliver those features.&quot; That is what&#xD;
    we refer to as the SRS Package.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;A Living Artifact&quot; name=&quot;A Living Artifact&quot;>A Living Artifact&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The SRS Package is not a frozen tome, produced to ensure ISO 9000 compliance and then buried in a corner and ignored as&#xD;
    the project continues. Instead, it is an active, living artifact. Indeed it has a number of uses as the developers&#xD;
    embark upon their implementation effort: It serves as a basis of communication between all parties - i.e., between the&#xD;
    developers themselves, and between the developers and the external groups (users and other stakeholders) with whom they&#xD;
    must communicate. Formally or informally, it represents a contractual agreement between the various parties - if it's&#xD;
    not in the SRS Package, the developers shouldn't be working on it. And if it is in the SRS Package, then they are&#xD;
    accountable to deliver that functionality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;The Project Members' Reference Standard&quot; name=&quot;The Project Members' Reference Standard&quot;>The Project Members'&#xD;
    Reference Standard&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The SRS serves as the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/roles/rup_project_manager_363CE680.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{EE97A8CD-66CA-4A9B-9871-E3B94CCED528}&quot;>Project Manager&lt;/a>'s reference standard. The project manager is unlikely&#xD;
    to have the time, energy, or skills to read the code being generated by the developers and compare that directly to the&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_vision_2D6D6F1.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{417F089F-6636-451A-A8AB-AB4EAC7AC4F1}&quot;>Vision&lt;/a> document. He or she must use the SRS Package as the standard&#xD;
    reference for discussions with the project team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As noted earlier, it serves as input to the design and implementation groups. Depending on how the project is&#xD;
    organized, the implementers may have been involved in the earlier problem-solving and feature-definition tasks that&#xD;
    ultimately produced the Vision document. But it's the SRS Package they need to focus on for deciding what their code&#xD;
    must do. It serves as input to the software testing and QA groups. These groups should also have been involved in some&#xD;
    of the earlier discussions, and it's obviously helpful for them to have a good understanding of the &quot;vision&quot; laid out&#xD;
    in the Vision documents. But their charter is to create test cases and QA procedures to ensure that the developed&#xD;
    system does indeed fulfill the requirements laid out in the SRS Package. The SRS Package also serves as the standard&#xD;
    reference for their planning and testing tasks.&#xD;

    Requirements&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The non-functional requirements of your system should be documented in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_supplementary_specification_F5ACAA22.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{B16C2941-791C-44E6-B353-354109B5C9DE}&quot;>Artifact: Supplementary Specifications&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp; Following are&#xD;
    guidelines to follow when defining these requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;1 General&quot; name=&quot;1 General&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;>1 General&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;1.1 Assumptions and Issues&quot; name=&quot;1.1 Assumptions and Issues&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>1.1 Assumptions and&#xD;
    Issues&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While gathering and validating non-functional requirements, maintain Assumptions and Issues lists.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some tasks will not give you satisfactory answers. This can be due to lack of information, or simply because you&#xD;
    consider the answer threatens the viability of the design. Therefore, create two lists, and maintain them through the&#xD;
    design study:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any assumptions you make during the requirements and design process, including the rationale or thought processes&#xD;
    behind those assumptions. Assumptions may be used to identify related subprojects or items of work which are outside&#xD;
    the scope of or after this project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any major issues (significant concerns that could become show-stoppers)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The issues should be reviewed with the customer at the and of each phase. The assumptions need to be reviewed also, at&#xD;
    the end of each phase, but the customer might not always be the correct person for the less important ones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assumptions and issues apply to all work products, but are particularly common for non-functional requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Organization&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document the client's geographic organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document the geographic locations of the part of the business affected by this system. The definition should include&#xD;
    those unaffected sites also, which host major IT facilities. Make special note of any part of the organization that is&#xD;
    mobile. For instance a sales force that will travel about and use workstations. Note any geographic locations at which&#xD;
    you may have to provide special natural language support (NLS).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Pre-selected Application Packages?&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do the requirements specify the use of any application packages? One very important &quot;given&quot; that may dictate strongly&#xD;
    some of the system design decisions is the use of a specific application package that provides predefined software&#xD;
    logic and data organization. Some software packages are flexible and allow a great deal of customization; some are very&#xD;
    rigid and do not. Packages may dictate components and decisions such as the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workstation type&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Connection methods&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Processor and Direct Access Storage Device type (DASD)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System Control Program&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data organization, placement and management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Programming language&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Batch interfaces&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process and data relationships&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business logic&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Screen design and user interfaces&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Performance and availability characteristics&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Any existing or required architecture for printing, such as preferred print data formats (for example, PostScript,&#xD;
        PCL, IPDT)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        National Language Support (NLS)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to understand what influences any given package will have upon your design. If you have a &quot;given&quot;&#xD;
    package, make sure you have the right skills and knowledge about this package available to you. This might come from:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The package vendor&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        External consultants&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specially trained design team members&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do not assume that this knowledge is readily available. Ensure that it will be available to you when you need it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;2.2 Other Givens&quot; name=&quot;2.2 Other Givens&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>2.2 Other Givens&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document any other givens in the requirements that will limit the flexibility of your design.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is to catch any specific requirements not explicitly covered in earlier tasks that might limit the flexibility of&#xD;
    your design. Look for any of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use of existing processors or operating system images&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use of existing workstation equipment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use of an existing network&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use of existing system management practices&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use of a specific model, such as: 'you must use a client/server system model for the design that clearly shows&#xD;
        Presentation/Business/Data Access Logic and where and how they interface'.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Will any of these givens affect the new system? If the new system is to run on an existing processor, operating system&#xD;
    image, or network configuration, are the characteristics of the existing platform and workload going to affect the new&#xD;
    system?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How much connection and processing capacity is already taken by existing workloads?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What security controls are used by existing workloads? Note these, and check them against the security requirements of&#xD;
    the new system when you consider the latter.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What are the availability characteristics of the existing workload?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note anything which might affect your later design of availability for the new system. For example, does the existing&#xD;
    workload insist on shutting down the whole of a processor each night?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;2.3 Special Hardware?&quot; name=&quot;2.3 Special Hardware?&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>2.3 Special Hardware?&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do the requirements specify the use of any special hardware?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This might be stated in generic terms (&quot;the system must support a high-speed flat-bed plotter&quot;) or be more specific&#xD;
    (&quot;the existing Panda Corp ATMs will be supported&quot;). Document, as far as you can:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Any hardware or software prerequisites&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The vendors and their support organizations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        National Language (NLS) Considerations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cryptographic equipment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;2.4 Existing Data?&quot; name=&quot;2.4 Existing Data?&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>2.4 Existing Data?&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do the requirements specify the use of existing data? If so, then this will influence your system design. Document:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        On which system(s) the data currently exists&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Its structure (such as, relational or flat file)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Its size&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Which users and what systems use this data today&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Availability considerations (such as periods when data is unavailable because of database maintenance or batch&#xD;
        task)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Can this data be moved or copied?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;3 Standards&quot; name=&quot;3 Standards&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;>3 Standards&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;

    size=&quot;+0&quot;>3.1 Technical Architecture / Strategic Plan&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the client have a technical architecture and/or IT strategic plan (or equivalent set of standards)?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A technical architecture is roughly equivalent to the following:&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document any requirements that specifically ask for, or exclude, the use of sub-architectures such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        OSI or SNA&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        UNIX**&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        SAA&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        PS/2* with OS/2* EE.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Special architectures that may be implied by the use of a packaged application solution. Remember some application&#xD;
    packages are architectural definitions in their own right.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document the degree of openness (that is, vendor independence and interoperability) required by the client. If there is&#xD;
    a technical architecture, then your design will almost certainly have to comply with it. You should read it and&#xD;
    understand the rules that will influence design of this system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;3.2 Network Architecture&quot; name=&quot;3.2 Network Architecture&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>3.2 Network&#xD;
    Architecture&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the client have a network architecture to which this system must conform? A network architecture is a common set&#xD;
    of rules for high-level connectivity, plus a common transport infrastructure. This might include the definition of a&#xD;
    backbone network, including concentrators and lines. If there is such an architecture, then understand the essential&#xD;
    rules and topology and document:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Considerations for physical topology (that is, whether the network is essentially rural or metropolitan and whether the&#xD;
    network attachment are densely populated versus loosely distributed).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What high-level connection functions are supported by the current network infrastructure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What communications standards are used (for example SNA, OSI, TCP/IP) to support these connections functions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What programming interfaces are supported.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any network architecture definitions of the connectivity between client/server layers or the base system model layers&#xD;
    like:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Relational data access between client workstations and LAN relational servers must be via the protocols of a&#xD;
        specific relational database product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The presentation logic must always be in the workstation and the data access logic must always be in a centralized&#xD;
        host system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;

    Policies&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the client have any stated policies for connections?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even if you don't have technical or network architectures, you may still have some connection policies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document any policies regarding:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The use of particular protocols or communication facilities (for connections within a single building or external&#xD;
        to the building or organization).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether any particular protocols are implicitly required to support existing equipment or software.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether existing physical connectivity facilities are to be used (that is, cabling or wiring, network or peripheral&#xD;
        controllers, and common carrier facilities). If not, there may be constraints on the type of physical facilities&#xD;
        that can be used (policies, government regulations, physical space, ownership of premises, involvement of third&#xD;
        parties). Document these.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If installation or modification of physical facilities is likely to be required, there may be a need to involve one&#xD;
        or more third parties (such as contractors or common carriers). Understand how the contracting or responsibility&#xD;
        would be managed. This is particularly important if the business interactions will involve international&#xD;
        connections.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Support of mobile users.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Does the client have any other policies, standards or rules not explicitly stated in their requirements? For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All new system interfaces for users must be designed to object oriented principles to allow drag and drop actions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All new systems must be based upon the client/server application model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All new systems must be defined with open standards&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Standards and policies for National Language Support (NLS) especially anything such as right-to-left text&#xD;
        operation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Security policy defining management responsibility and standards for user authentication, access control and data&#xD;
        protection.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Application interchange standards (such as UNEDIFACT or VISA) which may imply the use of special equipment for&#xD;
        connection or security.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If there are other policies, then make sure you understand them and have access to them so that you can ensure that&#xD;
    your design conforms to the standards in the later phases of the design process. The use of a packaged application&#xD;
    solution may well bring with it some implied standards.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What is the policy on allowing users or departments to add and/or develop their own local programs on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workstations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Servers (especially disk space usage)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without controls, you may find that local usage quickly uses up resources which are needed by the production systems&#xD;
    for which the local components were originally bought. You may find that you cannot install the production system by&#xD;
    the time it is finally ready for rollout.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;4 Numbers&quot; name=&quot;4 Numbers&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;>4 Numbers&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>4.1 &quot;Units of measurement&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work with the applications development personnel to break down the business processes into more granular units such as&#xD;
    smaller business processes or transactions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The reason for doing this is that you are going to capture numbers in the next question, and you have to decide what it&#xD;
    is you are going to count.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be aware that a business process may start several instances of smaller business transactions (for example multiple&#xD;
    item orders per customer order) and these multipliers should be remembered when you document the numbers. However, do&#xD;
    not get caught up with too much detail, particularly for a complex system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business &quot;process&quot; (for example, &quot;customer order handling&quot;) will typically be implemented by an &quot;application&quot; (an IT&#xD;
    term), or may span more than one application. Within each application, there will usually be many IT &quot;transactions&quot;,&#xD;
    for example, &quot;query stock level&quot; or &quot;generate customer letter&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Different communities use their own names to identify the units we are trying to agree. For example, &quot;transaction&quot;&#xD;
    might mean one thing to people with an applications development background, and a completely different thing to the&#xD;
    infrastructure team. It is important to work together to correlate the names and then collect the information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>4.2 &quot;Business volumes and sizings&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify and document volume and sizing information for each of the units in 4.1: &quot;Units of measurement&quot;, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How many users are expected to be using each business process or application on average and at peak times&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When the peaks are (daily, weekly, monthly etc., as appropriate)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At what rate transactions will need to be processed at peak and on average&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The number of data elements and instances in each data group and their sizes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>4.3 &quot;Business process performance criteria&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The client may have performance criteria specified for some or all the business processes. However, remember also to&#xD;
    document performance targets for system support processes (such as system backup) and applications development&#xD;
    processes if identified. For each category, document:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The response/turnaround requirements for each category&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Where these are to be measured&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether different criteria are acceptable at different times (for example off-peak/overnight)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether the criteria are to be met during recovery or fallback&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a performance guarantee is required&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What the impact will be on any party if the performance requirements are not met&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Express the minimum performance conditions required for the business process to be considered available (that is,&#xD;
        the point below which the system is considered to be &quot;unavailable&quot; instead of &quot;slow&quot;).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If a packaged application solution has already been chosen ensure that you have access to its performance&#xD;
        characteristics. You may not need them all now but you should be aware where to get them as they will probably be&#xD;
        needed in future tasks. It may also take a long time for third parties to deliver the figures you require, so ask&#xD;
        for them now.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;5 Availability&quot; name=&quot;5 Availability&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;>5 Availability&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;5.1 Availability Advice&quot; name=&quot;5.1 Availability Advice&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>5.1 Availability&#xD;
    Advice&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The recommended approach to establishing availability requirements is as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the true users of the system, the business processes they are performing, and the hours when the users&#xD;
        perform those processes&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analyze the impact of service availability (or unavailability) on users' ability to accomplish their business&#xD;
        objectives&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specify availability requirements that directly reflect what the users require to accomplish their business&#xD;
        objectives.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Be aware that if a packaged application solution has already been chosen, its structure and design may have a&#xD;
        significant influence upon the availability characteristics of the application as seen by the users. A package that&#xD;
        has not been designed to operate continuously may be very difficult to operate continuously, especially as regards&#xD;
        maintenance and batch windows.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider these guidelines as you form the availability requirements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rather than specifying &quot;global&quot; requirements for the entire system, specify availability requirements at a low&#xD;
        level of granularity (for example, by individual process, user group, data group, etc.). This gives the designer&#xD;
        more flexibility to meet the users' needs. This is particularly important for systems with very high continuous&#xD;
        availability requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some examples:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The statement &quot;The system must be up 24 hours per day to accommodate users in New York and Hong Kong&quot; leaves the&#xD;
        designer much less design flexibility than the statement &quot;New York users must be able to perform transactions on&#xD;
        THEIR data from 7AM to 7PM New York time and Hong Kong users must be able to perform transactions on THEIR data&#xD;
        from 7AM to 7PM Hong Kong time&quot;. In the latter case, the designer has the flexibility to perform maintenance on one&#xD;
        time zone's data or system components while the other time zone is still in the middle of their production day.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In an ATM application, it may be critical to accept deposits and dispense cash at 3AM Monday morning, while the&#xD;
        ability to provide exact account balances at that hour may be less critical.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Distinguish between availability characteristics that are DESIRED and those that are MANDATORY. For example &quot;The&#xD;
        ATM MUST be able to accept deposits and dispense cash 24 hours per day. It is DESIRED that the ATM be able to&#xD;
        provide the customer their exact account balance 24 hours a day; however occasional interruptions in the account&#xD;
        balance enquiry process can be accommodated, but they MUST be less than 10 minutes in duration and occur between&#xD;
        the hours of 3:00 and 4:00 AM&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the impact of not meeting a particular availability target cannot be directly related to the users' ability to&#xD;
        accomplish their business objectives, that target may not be a good one to state as an availability requirement for&#xD;
        the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Availability requirements that only indirectly reflect the availability as perceived by the user (for example &quot;The&#xD;
        IMS control region must be up&quot;) tend not to be as useful as those that do (for example &quot;Bank tellers must be able&#xD;
        to perform processes X and Y&quot;).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>5.2 &quot;Scheduled service hours&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each of the business processes and the groups of users who must perform them, identify the hours during which the&#xD;
    user must be able to perform that process. Remember also to do this for those processes which are not directly&#xD;
    associated with user group(s).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If there are user groups in different time zones (such as the earlier New York / Hong Kong example), treat them as&#xD;
    separate groups of users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also show if there will be occasional periods, such as business holidays, when the application may not be needed. (This&#xD;
    gives the designer the flexibility to use those periods for extended maintenance). What changes are anticipated in&#xD;
    these service hours over the projected life of the application?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The service hours of this system may also be affected by those of other systems with which this one interfaces.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How are the scheduled service hours of this system expected to change over its projected life?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>5.3 &quot;Service outage costs&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Understand the BUSINESS IMPACT, FINANCIAL COSTS, AND RISKS associated with service interruptions during the scheduled&#xD;
    service hours.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To identify what availability requirements are really important for this system, consider the set of business processes&#xD;
    and groups of users and identify the business impact that would result from:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A brief interruption or period of unacceptably slow response time during the scheduled hours. Define &quot;brief&quot; and&#xD;
        &quot;unacceptably slow&quot; as they relate to this particular application (see &quot;Business process performance criteria&quot;)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Various longer-duration interruptions in service during the above hours (a minute, a few minutes, 15 minutes, 30&#xD;
        minutes, an hour, two hours, four hours, etc.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Extended interruptions in service (a shift, a day, multiple days, etc.).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Also consider any processes which are not directly associated with a user group (for example, overnight check&#xD;
        clearing).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When assessing the impact of each outage, identify fallback procedures and consider how they can reduce the true&#xD;
    business impact of the outage.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to quantify this impact in financial terms (cost of lost staff or equipment productivity, value of lost current&#xD;
    business, estimated loss of future business due to customer dissatisfaction, interest expenses, regulatory penalties,&#xD;
    etc.).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Provide as many answers as necessary to reflect differences in the costs and risks associated with outages of different&#xD;
    duration's, at different times of the day, whether planned or unplanned, which business processes or users are&#xD;
    affected, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How is the business/financial impact of a service interruption anticipated to change during the projected life of this&#xD;
    system?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review each of these agreed important business processes to identify alternatives to allow the most critical elements&#xD;
    of those processes to proceed should some portions of the system become temporarily unavailable. The ability to operate&#xD;
    temporarily with reduced business function may be a way to help reduce the availability impact of interdependencies&#xD;
    among critical processes and data.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some examples:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        FULL FUNCTION 1 Read and update stock record.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        REDUCED FUNCTION 1 Enter update of stock record and queue for future update.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        FULL FUNCTION 2 Read most-recent customer balance.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        REDUCED FUNCTION 2 Read customer balance from an alternate source, which may not be quite as current.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        FULL FUNCTION 3 Update computer diary.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        REDUCED FUNCTION 3 Update printed paper copy of diary.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Remember that when the system is working with reduced function there may be a limit to which this is acceptable to the&#xD;
    business processes. For example, an out-of-date customer balance must not be more than 24 hours out-of-date.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If service is interrupted during the scheduled hours (see &quot;Scheduled service hours&quot;) the impact of the interruption&#xD;
    will usually vary depending on outage duration and other conditions. Some outages may have minimal impact on the users'&#xD;
    ability to perform their business processes (brief outages, those which occur during lightly-used periods of the day,&#xD;
    those which impact only a subset of the user group, or those for which an acceptable manual fallback procedure exists).&#xD;
    Other outages, such as those which are longer or occur during a &quot;critical&quot; period of the day, may have a more&#xD;
    significant impact.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some examples:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A brief outage of manufacturing line control processes might have minimal impact on productivity, since work can&#xD;
        continue based on previously-printed work orders and changes can be noted manually for later entry. However, an&#xD;
        outage extending beyond sixty minutes may result in the shutdown of the line for the remainder of the shift.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An outage of a high-dollar-volume financial settlement system during the last hour of trading might result in&#xD;
        significant interest costs or regulatory penalties.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Police and fire department responses to life-threatening emergencies can continue using manual fallback procedures&#xD;
        if a dispatching system is unavailable. However the response times may increase, and potentially threaten lives,&#xD;
        due to the increased dispatcher workload.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A peak-period outage of an airline or hotel reservations system may not only result in a loss of current business&#xD;
        when customers call a competitor to make their reservations, but may also result in a loss of future business if&#xD;
        customers become dissatisfied enough to call another airline or hotel first the next time they need these services.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>5.4 &quot;Availability and recovery criteria&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the AVAILABILITY AND RECOVERY CRITERIA that would apply under &quot;normal&quot; situations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Exclude &quot;disaster&quot; situations, such as an extended loss or shutdown of the entire computing facility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Based on the business/financial costs and risks identified in &quot;Service outage costs&quot;, develop a specification of the&#xD;
    availability criteria that must be met to avoid significantly inhibiting user groups from performing their assigned&#xD;
    business processes. Such criteria might be specified in forms such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Percentage of outages recovered within a given number of minutes/seconds&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maximum amount of time over a given week/month/year when the user cannot perform a particular function&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be as specific as necessary to reflect factors such as differences between planned and unplanned outages, the hour&#xD;
    during which the outage occurs (for example &quot;critical&quot; periods versus lightly used periods) whether all users or only a&#xD;
    few are affected, etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be careful not to specify unnecessarily stringent availability criteria, as this could significantly affect the&#xD;
    implementation cost. In general, if significant business/financial costs or risks cannot be identified with a given set&#xD;
    of outage conditions, this may be an indication that this set of outage conditions should not be included in the stated&#xD;
    availability criteria.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If &quot;Scheduled service hours&quot; suggested that the scheduled service hours are likely to change, and/or &quot;Service outage&#xD;
    costs&quot; suggested that the business/financial costs or risks associated with a service interruption are likely to change&#xD;
    during the projected life of the system, estimate how the availability criteria would change as a result.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If cryptography is to be used, there will be additional recovery and availability considerations. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The ability to recover secret information that may be held outside of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The need to ensure that data which is protected cryptographically is recovered in co-ordination with the recovery&#xD;
        of the appropriate encryption keys&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>5.5 &quot;Disaster Recovery?&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Is disaster recovery required within the scope of this design project (availability during &quot;disaster&quot; situations, such&#xD;
    as extended loss or shutdown of the entire computing facility)? If so, what are the criteria for such recovery?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Be aware that probably not all business processes will require disaster recovery facilities. Select only those&#xD;
    processes that are critical and do require disaster recovery. Even within those processes, not all functions may need&#xD;
    to be covered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How soon must service be restored? Is this measured from when the disaster occurs, or from when a decision is made&#xD;
        to go to a remote site?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Under what conditions would the organization decide to recover at a remote site, rather than locally?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How current must the data be at the remote site for the business to continue operating (absolutely&#xD;
        up-to-the-second; within a few minutes of the failure; previous day's data acceptable)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When service is first restored from the remote site?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At some future point in time?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is the remote site recovery priority of this set of applications relative to other business applications&#xD;
        dependent on the same computing facility?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that there may be different sets of criteria for different parts of the system or depending on the type of&#xD;
    disaster.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What changes in the above disaster recovery requirements are anticipated during the projected life of the application?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>5.6 &quot;Other availability design considerations&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To design a system that recovers as quickly as possible, the designer needs to know what flexibility is available to&#xD;
    them in implementing the application, while still meeting the functional requirements of the application. Here are some&#xD;
    questions which may be of value to the designer:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    1. To accommodate necessary maintenance tasks, may the system operate for brief periods during which it would:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        a. Perform inquiry but not update?&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        b. Accept update requests from the user, but not actually update the DB until after the maintenance tasks have&#xD;
        completed?&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2. For an outage requiring recovery of data, is it more important to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        c. Restore service as quickly as possible, even if it means using data that is not completely up-to-date, or:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        d. Recover all data to their current state before restoring service, even if this takes longer?&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    3. Should a user request be &quot;in process&quot; at the time of failure, can the user be relied on to re-enter the request&#xD;
    following recovery of service?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    4. Are there any non-technical considerations that might affect the availability of this system (such as a business&#xD;
    policy which says that process A must not be made available to users unless process B is also available)?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Are any of the above design considerations expected to change over time?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For processes that are critical to the business, it is useful to identify alternatives which allow the most critical&#xD;
    elements of those processes to appear functional even when portions of the system are temporarily unavailable. The&#xD;
    ability to operate temporarily with reduced business function may be a way to help reduce the availability impact of&#xD;
    interdependencies among critical processes and data.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;6 Security&quot; name=&quot;6 Security&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;>6 Security&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;font size=&quot;+0&quot;>6.1 &quot;Security requirements&quot;&lt;/font>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    1. Identify data to be protected&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    2. Identify the type of threats to which each type of data is exposed:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Accidental corruption or destruction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deliberate corruption or destruction&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Commercial intelligence&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Fraud&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Hacking&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Viruses&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        1. Identify threats to physical security:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;blockquote>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Theft of components&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Unauthorized physical access&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Physical safety of users&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        2. Identify the people who may be the sources of these threats:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;blockquote>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Data center staff&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Other IT staff (for example, development)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Non-IT staff of the organization&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                People outside the organization&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        3. Identify any special or unusual security requirements especially with respect to:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;blockquote>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Access to the system&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Encryption of data&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Auditability&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        4. Are there any general policies, such as Freedom of Information acts, that might influence the security design of&#xD;
        this system?&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        5. Some packaged application solutions have their own security sub-systems. If you have a &quot;given&quot; package be aware&#xD;
        of its security facilities.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to establish and classify the security requirements, you may want to use the following approach:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        1. List the objects which require protection by logical or physical security.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        2. Identify the exposure which is relevant to each object. Typical categories are:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;blockquote>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                View access (breach of confidentiality), e.g. account information, client list, patents.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Update access, i.e. modification of data for fraud, cover-up, diversion of funds.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Loss of assets, i.e. somebody else gets a possession and it is no longer available to the owner (as&#xD;
                distinguished from loss due to disaster). Examples are: client and prospect lists, contracts, etc.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        Note that not all objects are sensitive to all of the above exposures.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        3. Identify all the threats which are relevant to your environment. Examples are:&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;blockquote>&#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Disgruntled employees&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Unauthorized employees&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Open terminal sessions in public place&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Hackers&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Line tapping&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Loss of equipment (e.g. portable PCs)&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        4. For each object establish which threat may apply and associate it with the particular exposure.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that you may have to review the security requirements for the object both in a static location (e.g. on a hard&#xD;
    disk) as well as in transit (e.g. during transmission).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Since the design may extend the location of the object into unsecured areas, you may have to revisit this subject.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The security aspects of some system designs can be very demanding. They can dominate your design decisions. They could&#xD;
    cause otherwise good options of structure and component selection to become unacceptable. So make a definite choice now&#xD;
    as to whether the system that you are designing has particularly demanding security requirements. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A sensitive military system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A high value money transfer system&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A system that handles confidential personal information&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you believe that you have special security demands then you should identify a Security Expert or Practitioner to&#xD;
    assist you in the design aspects of your system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;b>&lt;a id=&quot;6 Usability&quot; name=&quot;6 Usability&quot;>&lt;font size=&quot;4&quot;>7 Usability&lt;/font>&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usability requirements define how high the usability of the user interface must be.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The usability requirements should be set to the lowest level of usability that the system must achieve in order to be&#xD;
    used. They should not be set to what you believe the system can achieve. In other words, the usability requirements&#xD;
    should not be considered a target, i.e., an upper limit. Usability requirements should define the absolute lowest&#xD;
    acceptable system usability. Thus, you should not necessarily stop improving usability when usability requirements are&#xD;
    fulfilled&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What the system must achieve, in order to be used, depends mostly on what the alternative to using the system is. It is&#xD;
    reasonable to require that the system should be significantly more usable than the alternatives. The alternatives can&#xD;
    be to utilize:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Existing manual procedures.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Legacy system(s).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Competing products.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Earlier version(s) of the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Usability requirements can also come from the need to economically justify the new system: if the customer has to pay&#xD;
    $3 million for the new system, he might want to impose usability requirements that imply that he will save perhaps $1&#xD;
    million per year because of decreased workload on his human resources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are examples of some general usability requirements:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maximum execution time - how long it should take a trained user to execute a common scenario.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Maximum error rate - how many errors a trained user will average for a common scenario.&lt;br />&#xD;
         The only errors that are relevant to measure are those that are unrecoverable and will have negative effects on&#xD;
        the organization, such as losing business, or causing damage to monitored hardware. If the only consequence of an&#xD;
        error is that it takes time to fix, this will affect the measured execution time.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Learning time - how long it takes before the user can execute a scenario faster than the specified maximum&#xD;
        execution time.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following is an example of some specific usability requirements for a &quot;Manage Incoming Mail Messages&quot; Use Case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Mail User should be able to arrange Mail Messages with a single mouse click.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Mail User should be able to scroll Mail Message texts by pressing single keyboard buttons.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Mail User should not be disturbed by incoming Mail Messages when reading existing Mail Messages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
