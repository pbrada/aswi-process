        Conduct reviews in a meeting format, although the participants of the meetings might prepare some reviews on their&#xD;
        own.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Continuously monitor quality during the process tasks to prevent large numbers of defects from remaining hidden&#xD;
        until the reviews. In each task in the Rational Unified Process (RUP), the checklist listed below are referenced to&#xD;
        reinforce this; use them for informal review meetings or in daily work.&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;TypesOfReviews&quot; name=&quot;TypesOfReviews&quot;>Types of Reviews&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In a 1990 standard glossary, IEEE defines three kinds of reviews:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;dl>&#xD;
        &lt;dt>&#xD;
            &lt;b>&lt;i>Review&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&#xD;
        &lt;/dt>&#xD;
        &lt;dd>&#xD;
            A formal meeting at which a work product, or a set of work products are presented to the user, customer, or&#xD;
            other interested parties for comments and approval.&#xD;
        &lt;/dd>&#xD;
        &lt;dt>&#xD;
            &lt;b>&lt;i>Inspection&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&#xD;
        &lt;/dt>&#xD;
        &lt;dd>&#xD;
            A formal evaluation technique in which work products are examined in detail by a person or group other than the&#xD;
            author to detect errors, violations of development standards, and other problems.&#xD;
        &lt;/dd>&#xD;
        &lt;dt>&#xD;
            &lt;b>&lt;i>Walkthrough&lt;/i>&lt;/b>&#xD;
        &lt;/dt>&#xD;
        &lt;dd>&#xD;
            A review process in which a developer leads one or more members of the development team through a segment of a&#xD;
            work product that he or she has written while the other members ask questions and make comments about&#xD;
            technique, style, possible error, violation of development standards, and other problems.&#xD;
        &lt;/dd>&#xD;
    &lt;/dl>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When implemented across teams, reviews also provide opportunities for people to discover design and code from other&#xD;
    groups, and increase the chances of detecting common source code, reuse opportunities, and opportunities for&#xD;
    generalization. Reviews also provide a way to coordinate the architectural style among various groups.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the RUP, reviews play an important though secondary part in assuring quality. The major contributors to quality in&#xD;
    the RUP are well described in [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html#ROY98&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>ROY98&lt;/a>] in the&#xD;
    section on Peer Inspections. However, this book does identify a valuable additional effect of reviews in professional&#xD;
    development: junior staff have the opportunity to see the work of experts, and have their own work reviewed by senior&#xD;
    mentors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Planning&quot; name=&quot;Planning&quot;>Planning&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We plan reviews to determine the focus and scope of the review, and to make sure all participants understand their&#xD;
    role, and the goals of the review.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Prior to the review, define the scope of the review by determining the question that will be asked; define what will be&#xD;
    assessed and why? See the Checklist for the work products to be reviewed for the types of questions that could be&#xD;
    asked. The exact questions will depend on the phase in the project: earlier reviews will be concerned with broader&#xD;
    architectural issues, later reviews will be more specific.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the scope of the review has been determined, define the review participants, the agenda, the information that will&#xD;
    be required to perform the review. In selecting the participants, establish balance between software architecture&#xD;
    expertise and domain expertise. Clearly and unambiguously designate an assessment leader who will coordinate the&#xD;
    review. If necessary, draw upon other teams or other parts of the organization to supply domain or technical expertise.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The number of reviewers should be approximately seven or less. If chosen appropriately, they will be more than capable&#xD;
    of identifying problems in the architecture. More reviewers actually reduce the quality of the review by making the&#xD;
    meetings longer, making participation more difficult, and by injecting side issues and discussion into the review.&#xD;
    Fewer than 4 reviewers increases the risk of review myopia, as the diversity of concerns is reduced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviewers should be experienced in the area to be reviewed; for use cases, reviewers should have an understanding of&#xD;
    the problem domain; for software architecture a knowledge of software design techniques is also needed. Inexperienced&#xD;
    reviewers may learn something about the architecture by participating, but they will contribute little to the review&#xD;
    and their presence may be distracting. Keep the group small; no more than seven people and no fewer than three. Fewer&#xD;
    reviewers jeopardize the quality of the review, and more reviewers prevent interactive discussion essential to&#xD;
    achieving quality results.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Select reviewers appropriate for the material:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        those who have the background to understand the material presented&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        those who have an active stake in the quality of product or work product being reviewed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;PrepareReview&quot; name=&quot;PrepareReview&quot;>Preparation&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Prior to the review, the work products to be reviewed and any background material should be gathered and distributed to&#xD;
    the review participants. This must be done sufficiently in advance of the review meeting for reviewers to review the&#xD;
    material and gather issues. Distributing review materials sufficiently in advance, and allowing reviewers to have time&#xD;
    to prepare for the review significantly improves the quality of review results. Preparation for reviews also greatly&#xD;
    improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the review.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviewers should study the documentation, forming questions and identifying issues to discuss, &lt;b>prior to the&#xD;
    review&lt;/b>. Given normal workload of reviewers, a few working days is usually the minimum time needed to prepare for&#xD;
    the review.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;ConductReview&quot; name=&quot;ConductReview&quot;>Conducting Reviews&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several keys to conducting a successful review:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#UnderstandReviewProcess&quot;>Understand the review process&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#UnderstandReviewerRoles&quot;>Make sure that reviewers understand their roles&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Moderator&quot;>Have a moderator&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#KeepReviewMeetingsBrief&quot;>Keep the review short and stick to the agenda&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#IdentifyIssuesDontFixProblems&quot;>Identify issues, don't fix problems&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each of these is discussed in detail below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;UnderstandReviewProcess&quot; name=&quot;UnderstandReviewProcess&quot;>Understand the review process&lt;/a> &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;#ConductReview&quot;>&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; alt=&quot;To Conduct Review&quot; src=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot;&#xD;
    border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general, the review process follows a repetitive cycle:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An issue is raised by a reviewer&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The issue is discussed, and potentially confirmed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A defect is identified (something is identified as needing to be addressed)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Continue until no more issues are identified&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order for this to work effectively, everyone must understand that the goal of a review is to improve the quality of&#xD;
    the reviewed work product. The work products should be reviewed with a critical eye to finding problems. Doing this can&#xD;
    be difficult, so all reviewers must constantly remind themselves to focus on identifying issues (we are all natural&#xD;
    problem solvers, but as reviewers we must put that aside).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We all have strong ownership of our work; it is often difficult to accept criticism, even when it is constructive. As a&#xD;
    result, we must work even harder to focus on the goals of the review: to make that work better.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;UnderstandReviewerRoles&quot; name=&quot;UnderstandReviewerRoles&quot;>Understand reviewer roles&lt;/a> &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;#ConductReview&quot;>&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; alt=&quot;To Conduct Review&quot; src=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot;&#xD;
    border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to conduct an effective review, everyone has a role to play. More specifically, there are certain roles that&#xD;
    must be played, and reviewers cannot switch roles easily. The basic roles in a review are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the moderator&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the recorder&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the presenter&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        reviewers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The moderator makes sure that the review follows its agenda and stays focused on the topic at hand. The moderator&#xD;
    ensures that side-discussions do not derail the review, and that all reviewers participate equally.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The recorder is an often overlooked, but essential part of the review team. Keeping track of what was discussed and&#xD;
    documenting actions to be taken is a full-time task. Assigning this task to one of the reviewers essentially keeps them&#xD;
    out of the discussion. Worse yet, failing to document what was decided will likely lead to the issue coming up again in&#xD;
    the future. Make sure to have a recorder and make sure that this is the only role the person plays.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The presenter is the author of the work product under review. The presenter explains the work product and any&#xD;
    background information needed to understand it (although if the work product was not self-explanatory, it probably&#xD;
    needs some work). It's important that reviews not become &quot;trials&quot; - the focus should be on the work product, not on the&#xD;
    presenter. It is the moderator's role to make sure that participants (including the presenter) keep this in mind. The&#xD;
    presenter is there to kick-off the discussion, to answer questions and to offer clarification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviewers raise issues. It's important to keep focused on this, and not get drawn into side discussions of how to&#xD;
    address the issue. Focus on results, not the means.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Moderator&quot; name=&quot;Moderator&quot;>Have a moderator&lt;/a> &lt;a href=&quot;#ConductReview&quot;>&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;To Conduct Review&quot; src=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As discussed above, the moderator plays a crucial role in keeping the review from losing focus. It's important that the&#xD;
    moderator be focused on keeping the review on track; the moderator should not have reviewer responsibilities. The role&#xD;
    of the moderator is to elicit discussion, ensure equal participation, and to defuse contention. This is a full-time&#xD;
    task. Failure to moderate effectively causes reviews to drag on beyond their intended conclusion, and to fail to&#xD;
    achieve their goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;KeepReviewMeetingsBrief&quot; name=&quot;KeepReviewMeetingsBrief&quot;>Keep the review meetings brief&lt;/a> &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;#ConductReview&quot;>&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; alt=&quot;To Conduct Review&quot; src=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot;&#xD;
    border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reviews are most effective when they are brief and focused on well-identified objectives. Because it is difficult to&#xD;
    maintain focus for long periods, and because reviewers have other work to do as well, limit reviews to no more than two&#xD;
    hours. If a review is expected to go longer, break it into several smaller and more focused reviews. Results will be&#xD;
    better if reviewers can maintain focus.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key to doing this is to have a well-identified agenda and clearly articulated goals. These should be communicated&#xD;
    when the review materials are distributed, and the moderator should reinforce them when the review meeting begins. The&#xD;
    moderator must then consistently (and sometime ruthlessly) reinforce these goals during the meeting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;IdentifyIssuesDontFixProblems&quot; name=&quot;IdentifyIssuesDontFixProblems&quot;>Identify issues, don't fix problems&lt;/a> &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;#ConductReview&quot;>&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; alt=&quot;To Conduct Review&quot; src=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot;&#xD;
    border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the major reasons why review meetings fail to achieve their intended results is that they have a tendency to&#xD;
    degenerate into discussions of how a problem should be fixed. Fixing problems usually requires investigation and&#xD;
    reflection; the format of the review is not an effective medium for this kind of discussion. Once the issue is&#xD;
    identified, determine if it is a defect that must be resolved, and then assign it to someone to investigate and&#xD;
    resolve. The review meeting should focus on identification only.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the issue requires further discussion among a group of people, form a separate meeting to focus on that topic.&#xD;
    Typically this meeting will require some investigation and preparation, and people with the right skills will need to&#xD;
    be involved. The review should remain focused on identifying other issues. The moderator will often need to exert&#xD;
    considerable will to keep the review meeting focused on this.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;TakingActionOnResults&quot; name=&quot;TakingActionOnResults&quot;>Taking Action on Review Results&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The review is of little value if nothing comes of it. At the conclusion of the review:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prioritize the list of problems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create defects to track the problems and their resolution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If additional investigation is required, assign a small team to research the problem (but not to solve it).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For problems that can be resolved in the current iteration, assign a person or team to fix the problem.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Feed the list of unresolved problems into future iteration planning efforts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
