&lt;p>&#xD;
    To fully understand the system's purpose you must know &lt;b>who&lt;/b> the system is for, that is, who will be using the&#xD;
    system. Different user types are represented as actors&lt;i>.&lt;/i>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_actor__definition&quot; name=&quot;XE_actor__definition&quot;>&lt;/a>An actor is anything that exchanges data with the system.&#xD;
    An actor can be a user, external hardware, or another system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The difference between an actor and an individual system user is that an actor represents a particular class of user&#xD;
    rather than an actual user. Several users can play the same role, which means they can be one and the same actor. In&#xD;
    that case, each user constitutes an instance of the actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Ivar and Mark are operators of a recycling machine. When they are using the machine each is represented by an instance&#xD;
    of the actor Operator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, in some situations, only one person plays the role modeled by an actor. For example, there may be only one&#xD;
    individual playing the role of system administrator for a rather small system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The same user can also act as several actors (that is, the same person can take on different roles).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;img height=&quot;139&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/md_acto3.gif&quot; width=&quot;367&quot; />&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    What in the system's surroundings will become actors to the system?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start by thinking of individuals who will use the system. How can you categorize them? It is often a good habit to keep&#xD;
    a few individuals (two or three) in mind and make sure that the actors you identify cover their needs. The following&#xD;
    set of questions is useful to have in mind when you are identifying actors:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who will supply, use, or remove information?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who will use this functionality?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who is interested in a certain requirement?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Where in the organization is the system used?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who will support and maintain the system?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What are the system's external resources?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What other systems will need to interact with this one?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several different aspects of a system's surroundings that you will represent as separate actors:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Users who execute the system's main functions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    For a Depot-Handling System, which supports the work in a depot, there are several categories of users: Depot Staff,&#xD;
    Order Registry Clerk, Depot Manager. All these categories have specific roles in the system and you should therefore&#xD;
    represent each one by a separate actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Users who execute the system's secondary functions, such as system administration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    In a recycling machine used for recycling cans, bottles, and crates, Customer is the main actor, the one for whom the&#xD;
    system is primarily built. Someone has to manage the machine, however. This role is represented by the actor Operator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        External hardware the system uses.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    A ventilation system that controls the temperature in a building continuously gets metered data from sensors in the&#xD;
    building. Sensor is therefore an actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other systems interacting with the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    An automated teller machine must communicate with the central system that holds the bank accounts. The central system&#xD;
    is probably an external one, and should therefore be an actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are building a internet-based application, your primary actors will in a sense be anonymous. You don't really&#xD;
    know who they are, and you cannot make any assumptions about their skills and background. But you can still describe&#xD;
    the role you expect them to play towards your system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;exampleheading&quot;>&#xD;
    Example:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    Systems that provide information (such as search engines) will have purely anonymous actors who access the application&#xD;
    only to find information about a particular topic.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;exampleheading&quot;>&#xD;
    Example:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    Government-informational sites whose charter is to provide information to any citizen or 'netizen' about laws and&#xD;
    regulations, practices, forms, and so on. For example, in the US the Internal Revenue Service has page that provides&#xD;
    information around how to complete a tax return. This includes having all forms available electronically, as well as&#xD;
    allowing individuals to file their tax return electronically. The role of the primary actor in this case is anyone&#xD;
    interested in how you file a tax return in the US. Of course, once the individual attempts filing the return, she can&#xD;
    no longer be anonymous.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Actors Help Define System Boundaries&quot; name=&quot;Actors Help Define System Boundaries&quot;>Actors Help Define System&#xD;
    Boundaries&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Finding the actors also means that you establish the boundaries of the system, which helps in understanding the purpose&#xD;
    and extent of the system. Only those who directly communicate with the system need to be considered as actors. If you&#xD;
    are including more roles than that in the system's surroundings, you are attempting to model the business in which the&#xD;
    system will be used, not the system itself.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    In an airline booking system, what would the actor be? This depends on whether you are building a airline booking&#xD;
    system to be used by a travel agent, or whether you are building a system to which the passenger can connect directly&#xD;
    through Internet.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;120&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;Diagram shows a traveler interacting with a Travel Agent who is interacting with an Airline Booking System.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;resources/actor2.gif&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    If you are building an airline booking system to be used at a travel agent, the actor would be travel agent. The&#xD;
    traveler doesn't interact directly with the system, and is therefore not an actor&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;120&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram shows a traveler directly interacting with an Airline Booking System.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;resources/actor3.gif&quot; width=&quot;242&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    If you are building a booking system that will allow users to connect via the Internet, the traveler will interact&#xD;
    directly with the system and is therefore an actor to it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Brief Description&quot; name=&quot;Brief Description&quot;>Brief Description&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The brief description of the actor should include information about:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What or who the actor represents.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Why the actor is needed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What interests the actor has in the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The brief description should be, at most, a few sentences long.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    In the use-case model of the Recycling Machine, the three actors are briefly described as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Customer&lt;/b>: The Customer collects bottles, cans and crates at home and brings them back to the shop to get a&#xD;
    refund.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Operator&lt;/b>: The Operator is responsible for maintenance of the recycling machine.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Manager&lt;/b>: The Manager is responsible for questions about money and the service the store delivers to the&#xD;
    customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Actor Characteristics&quot; name=&quot;Actor Characteristics&quot;>Actor Characteristics&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The characteristics of an actor might influence how the system is developed, and in particular how an optimally usable&#xD;
    user interface is visually shaped. Note that if business workers corresponding to the actors are already described in a&#xD;
    business-object model, some of the following characteristics may have already been captured. The actor characteristics&#xD;
    include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The actor's scope of responsibility.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The physical environment in which the actor will be using the system. Deviations from the ideal case (where the&#xD;
        user sits in a silent office, with no distractions), might affect the use of such things as sound, the choice of&#xD;
        font, and the appropriate use of input device combinations (e.g., keyboard, touch screen, mouse, and hot-keys.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The number of users represented by this actor. This number is a relevant factor when determining the significance&#xD;
        of the actor, and the significance of the parts of the user interface that the actor uses.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The frequency with which the actor will use the system. This frequency will determine how much (of the user&#xD;
        interface) the actor can be expected to remember between sessions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In most cases, a rough estimate of the number of users and frequency of use will suffice. A difference between 30 and&#xD;
    40 will not affect how the user interface is shaped, but a difference between 3 and 30 might.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Other actor characteristics include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The actor's level of domain knowledge. This level will help determine how much domain-specific help is needed, and&#xD;
        how much domain-specific terminology should be used in the user interface.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The actor's level of general computer experience. This level will help determine how appropriate sophisticated&#xD;
        versus simplistic interaction techniques are in the user interface.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other applications that the actor uses. Borrowing user-interface concepts from these applications will shorten the&#xD;
        actor's learning time and decrease his memory load, since the actor is already familiar with these concepts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        General characteristics of the actors, such as level of expertise (education), social implications (language), and&#xD;
        age. These characteristics can influence details of the user interface, such as font and language.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These characteristics are used primarily when identifying the boundary classes and the prototype, to ensure the best&#xD;
    usability match between the user community and the user interface design.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    The following is an example of characteristics of the Mail User actor. This is the actor that, amongst other things,&#xD;
    interacts with the Manage Incoming Mail Messages use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            The mail user is an experienced PC user.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            The work environment of the mail user is typically a quiet office.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            The targeted number of mail users is 500,000.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
