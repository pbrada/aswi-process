    Software problems are 100 to 1000 times more costly to find and repair after deployment. Verifying and managing quality&#xD;
    throughout the project's lifecycle is essential to achieving the right objectives at the right time.&#xD;

    Throughout the Lifecycle&lt;/a>?&#xD;
&lt;/h2>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's important that the quality of all artifacts are assessed at several points in the project's lifecycle as they&#xD;
    mature. Artifacts should be evaluated as the activities that produce them complete and at the conclusion of each&#xD;
    iteration. In particular, as executable software is produced, it should be subjected to demonstration and test of&#xD;
    important scenarios in each iteration, which provides a more tangible understanding of design trade-offs and earlier&#xD;
    elimination of architectural defects. This is in contrast to a more traditional approach that leaves the testing of&#xD;
    integrated software until late in the project's lifecycle.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quality is something we all strive for in our products, processes, and services. Yet when asked, &quot;What is Quality?&quot;,&#xD;
    everyone has a different opinion. Common responses include one or the other of these:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Quality ... I'm not sure how to describe it, but I'll know it when I see it.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;... meeting requirements.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Perhaps the most frequent reference to quality, specifically related to software, is this remark regarding its absence:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &quot;How could they release something like this with such low quality!?&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These commonplace responses are telling, but they offer little room to rigorously examine quality and improve upon its&#xD;
    execution. These comments all illustrate the need to define quality in a manner in which it can be measured and&#xD;
    achieved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quality, however, is not a singular characteristic or attribute. It's multi-dimensional and can be possessed by a&#xD;
    product or a process. Product quality is concentrated on building the right product, whereas process quality is focused&#xD;
    on building the product correctly. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/product_quality_FBA62FF9.html&quot; guid=&quot;1.4115637419216196E-305&quot;>Concept: Product&#xD;
    Quality&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/process_quality_BA2B2D83.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;3.50818511362594E-305&quot;>Concept: Process Quality&lt;/a> for additional information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Definition of Quality&quot; name=&quot;Definition of Quality&quot;>Definition of Quality&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The definition of quality, taken from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, 3rd Edition, Houghton&#xD;
    Mifflin Co.,&amp;copy; 1992, 1996, is:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Quality&lt;/b> (kwol'i-te) n., pl. &lt;b>-ties&lt;/b>. &lt;b>1.a.&lt;/b> An inherent or distinguishing characteristic; a&#xD;
        property. &lt;b>b.&lt;/b> A personal trait, especially a character trait. &lt;b>2.&lt;/b> Essential character; nature.&#xD;
        &lt;b>3.a.&lt;/b> Superiority of kind. &lt;b>b.&lt;/b> Degree or grade of excellence.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As demonstrated by this definition, quality is not a single dimension, but many. To use the definition and apply it to&#xD;
    software development, the definition must be refined. Therefore, for the purposes of the Rational Unified Process&#xD;
    (RUP), quality is defined as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &quot;...the characteristic of having demonstrated the achievement of producing a product that meets or exceeds&#xD;
        agreed-on requirements-as measured by agreed-on measures and criteria-and that is produced by an agreed-on&#xD;
        process.&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Achieving quality is not simply &quot;meeting requirements&quot;, or producing a product that meets user needs and expectations.&#xD;
    Rather, quality also includes identifying the measures and criteria to demonstrate the achievement of quality, and the&#xD;
    implementation of a process to ensure that the product created by the process has achieved the desired degree of&#xD;
    quality, and can be repeated and managed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also the following pages for additional information on how the RUP defines the idea of quality:&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A common misconception is that quality is owned by, or is the responsibility of, one group. This myth is often&#xD;
    perpetuated by creating a group, sometimes called Quality Assurance-other names include Test, Quality Control, and&#xD;
    Quality Engineering-and giving them the charter and the responsibility for quality.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quality is, and should be, the responsibility of everyone. Achieving quality must be integral to almost all process&#xD;
    activities, instead of a separate discipline, thereby making everyone responsible for the quality of the products (or&#xD;
    artifacts) they produce and for the implementation of the process in which they are involved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each role contributes to the achievement of quality in the following ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Product quality-the contribution to the overall achievement of quality in each artifact being produced.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process quality-the achievement of quality in the process activities for which they are involved.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Everyone shares in the responsibility and glory for achieving a high-quality product, or in the shame of a low-quality&#xD;
    product. But only those directly involved in a specific process component are responsible for the glory, or shame, for&#xD;
    the quality of those process components (and the artifacts). Someone, however, must take the responsibility for&#xD;
    managing quality; that is, providing the supervision to ensure that quality is being managed, measured, and achieved.&#xD;
    The role responsible for managing quality is the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/roles/rup_project_manager_363CE680.html&quot; guid=&quot;{EE97A8CD-66CA-4A9B-9871-E3B94CCED528}&quot;>Project&#xD;
    Manager&lt;/a>.&#xD;

    Quality&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many misconceptions regarding quality and the most common include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Quality%20can%20be%20added%20to,%20or%20tested%20into%20a%20product:&quot;>Quality can be added to or &quot;tested&quot;&#xD;
        into a product&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a&#xD;
        href=&quot;#Quality%20is%20a%20single%20dimension,%20attribute,%20or%20characteristic%20and%20means%20the%20same%20thing%20to%20everyone&quot;>Quality&#xD;
        is a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic and means the same thing to everyone&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Quality%20happens%20on%20its%20own:&quot;>Quality happens on its own&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Quality can be added to, or tested into a product:&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Quality can be added to, or tested into a product:&quot;>Quality can be added to or &quot;tested&quot; into a product&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Just as a product cannot be produced if there is no description of what it is, what it needs to do, who uses it and how&#xD;
    it's used, and so on, quality and its achievement cannot be attained if it's not described, measured, and part of the&#xD;
    process of creating the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/measuring_quality_DB514DCE.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;6.598272130059516E-306&quot;>Concept: Measuring Quality&lt;/a> and the section of this document titled &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;#Quality%20happens%20on%20its%20own:&quot;>Quality happens on its own&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Quality is a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic and means the same thing to everyone&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Quality is a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic and means the same thing to everyone&quot;>Quality is a&#xD;
    single dimension, attribute, or characteristic and means the same thing to everyone&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quality is not a single dimension, attribute, or characteristic. Quality is measured in many ways-quality metrics and&#xD;
    criteria are established to meet the needs of project, organization, and customer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quality can be measured along several dimensions-some apply to process quality; some to product quality; some to both.&#xD;
    Quality can be measured for:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Progress-such as use cases demonstrated or milestones completed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Variance-differences between planned and actual schedules, budgets, staffing requirements, and so forth&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reliability-resistance to failure (crashing, hanging, memory leaks, and so on) during execution&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Function-the artifact implements and executes the required use cases as intended&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Performance-the artifact executes and responds in a timely and acceptable manner, and continues to perform&#xD;
        acceptably when subjected to real-world operational characteristics such as load, stress, and lengthy periods of&#xD;
        operation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quality cannot happen by itself. For quality to be achieved, a process is must be implemented, adhered to, and&#xD;
    measured. The purpose of the RUP is to provide a disciplined approach to assigning tasks and responsibilities within a&#xD;
    development organization. Our goal is to ensure the production of high-quality software that meets the needs of our&#xD;
    users, within a predictable schedule and budget. The RUP captures many of the best practices in modern software&#xD;
    development in a form that can be tailored for a wide range of projects and organizations. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/capabilitypatterns/environment_88B1B954.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{659D51DD-DF1F-465E-9F3A-2FC6F9BC7C34}&quot;>Environment&lt;/a> discipline gives you guidance about how to best configure&#xD;
    the process to your needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Processes can be configured and quality-criteria for acceptability-can be negotiated, based upon several factors. The&#xD;
    most common factors are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risk (including liability)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Market opportunities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Revenue requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Staffing or scheduling issues&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Budgets&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Changes in the process and criteria for acceptability should be identified and agreed upon at the outset of the&#xD;
    project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    name=&quot;Management of Quality in the Rational Unified Process&quot;>Management of Quality in the RUP&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Managing quality is done for these purposes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To identify appropriate indicators (metrics) of acceptable quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To identify appropriate measures to be used in evaluating and assessing quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To identify and appropriately address issues affecting quality as early and effectively as possible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Managing quality is implemented throughout all disciplines, workflows, phases, and iterations in the RUP. In general,&#xD;
    managing quality throughout the lifecycle means you implement, measure, and assess both process quality and product&#xD;
    quality. Some of the efforts expended to manage quality in each discipline are highlighted in the following list:&#xD;

        artifact set for consistency (between artifact standards and other artifacts), clarity (clearly communicates&#xD;
        information to all shareholders, stakeholders, and other roles), and precision (the appropriate level of detail and&#xD;
        accuracy).&#xD;
