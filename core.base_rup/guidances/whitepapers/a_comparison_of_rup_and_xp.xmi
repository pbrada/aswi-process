    Abstract
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    Labeling RUP as heavyweight and XP as lightweight without further qualification does both a disservice by obscuring
    what each is and what each was intended to do. And, when done in a pejorative way, it's simply meaningless posturing.
    It is the implementations of these as processes that will be either &quot;heavyweight&quot; or &quot;lightweight&quot;, and they should be
    as heavy or light as circumstances require them to be.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    XP is not a free form, anything goes discipline-it focuses narrowly on a particular aspect of software development and
    a way of delivering value, and is quite prescriptive about the way this is to be achieved.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    RUP's coverage is much broader and just as deep, which explains its apparent &quot;size&quot;. However, at the micro level of
    process, RUP occasionally allows and offers equally valid alternatives, where XP does not; for example, the practice of
    pair programming, which is required by XP. This is not intended as a criticism of XP; simply an illustration of how XP,
    as its name implies, has narrowed its focus.
