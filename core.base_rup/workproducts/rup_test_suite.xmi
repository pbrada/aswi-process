    The Test Suite provides a means of managing the complexity of the test implementation. Many system test efforts fail&#xD;
    because the team gets lost in the minutia of all of the detailed tests, and subsequently loses control of the test&#xD;
    effort. Similar to UML packages, Test Suites provide a hierarchy of encapsulating containers to help manage the test&#xD;
    implementation. They provide a means of managing the strategic aspects of the test effort by collecting tests together&#xD;
    in related groups that can be planned, managed, and assessed in a meaningful way.&#xD;

    Each Test Suite needs to consider various aspects, including the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        compatibly and relevance of the individual tests to be executed by the Test Suite, especially in terms of test&#xD;
        objective and scope&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        points from which the Test Suite can be recovered or resumed if execution is halted&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        required configuration settings for the Test Suite of both hardware and software; for example, video-display&#xD;
        resolution, resource allocation, environment variables, and so forth&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        pre-existing consumables required by the Test Suite, such as populated data sets, receipt printer dockets, and so&#xD;
        on&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work product represents a container for organizing arbitrary collections of related tests. This may be realized&#xD;
    (implemented) as one or more automated regression Test Suites, but the Test Suite can also be a work plan for the&#xD;
    implementation of a group of related manual tests. Note also that Test Suites can be nested hierarchically, therefore&#xD;
    one Test Suite may be enclosed within another.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes these groups of tests will relate directly to a subsystem or other system design element, but other times&#xD;
    they'll relate directly to things such as quality dimensions, core &quot;mission critical&quot; functions, requirements&#xD;
    compliance, standards adherence, and many others concerns that cut across, or are not directly related to, the internal&#xD;
    system elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>You should consider creating Test Suites that arrange the available Test Scripts-in addition to other Test Suites-in&#xD;
many different combinations: the more variations you have, the more you'll increase coverage and the potential for finding&#xD;
errors. Give thought to a variety of Test Suites that will cover the breadth and depth of the target test items. Remember&#xD;
the corresponding implication that a single Test Script (or Test Suite) may appear in many different Test Suites. &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some test automation tools provide the ability to automatically generate or assemble Test Suites. There are also&#xD;
    implementation techniques that enable automated Test Suites to dynamically select all or part of their component Test&#xD;
    Scripts for each test cycle run.&lt;br />&#xD;
