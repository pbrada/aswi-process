  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An operation realization has the following outline:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Operation Name&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        List of subsystem operations realizing the operation, organized by elements specific to each chosen viewpoint:&#xD;
        subsystem (logical), locality (distribution), worker (worker), process (concurrency)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A budgeted requirement for each [subsystem operation, associated non-functional requirement] pair&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The realization is performed concurrently across the elements identified during Architectural Analysis and includes the&#xD;
    realization of the non-functional requirements associated with the operation. The typical diagrams employed are&#xD;
    communication and sequence diagrams which describe the behavioral aspects in terms of collaborating elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The designer is responsible for the integrity of the operation realization, and ensures that:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The operation realization correctly realizes the behavior of its corresponding operation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All the chosen viewpoints are addressed and there is at least one realization per viewpoint.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The associated non-functional requirements are correctly budgeted across the subsystems operations.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The operation realization is properly documented and the correspondent diagrams suit their purpose.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The realization associations are correct.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></keyConsiderations>
  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the operation realization is to describe the &quot;white-box&quot; perspective of the (sub)system under&#xD;
    consideration, separating the concerns of the specifiers from the concerns of the designers.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <representationOptions>&lt;p>&#xD;
    An Operation Realization is a multi-dimensional realization, one for each viewpoint. At the minimum there will be at&#xD;
    least one Logical realization for each Operation.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></representationOptions>
