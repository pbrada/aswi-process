    The Project Acceptance Review is a formal review between the project team and a customer representative. At this&#xD;
    review, the customer verifies that the product and supporting documentation delivered by the project meets the&#xD;
    requirements and objectives as set out in the Software Development Plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This review occurs after the product acceptance reviews and tests have been completed, at the end of the penultimate&#xD;
    iteration of the project (typically the final iteration would be the project close-out phase).&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Acceptance Review meeting is a meeting between a customer representative(s), the project's management team&#xD;
    (the project manager, plus the team leads for the various functional areas of the project team), and the Project Review&#xD;
    Authority.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the attendees of the meeting have been identified, set a date/time for the meeting to take place. It is important&#xD;
    that you provide sufficient lead time to allow the participants to review the materials that will be used as the basis&#xD;
    for the approval decision.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Prior to the meeting, distribute the review materials to the reviewers. Make sure these materials are sent out&#xD;
    sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow the reviewers adequate time to review them. At a minimum these&#xD;
    materials should include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Iteration Assessment for the iteration, including the product acceptance tests and reviews&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software Development Plan (with enclosed Product Acceptance Plan)&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the meeting, the attendees review the results of the product acceptance reviews and tests that are reported in&#xD;
    the Iteration Assessment. Using the product acceptance criteria from the Product Acceptance Plan, the group determines&#xD;
    the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Physical audit results - has the customer received all the project deliverables?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Functional audit results - did the results of the product acceptance reviews and test demonstrate that the product&#xD;
        satisfies its requirements?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Has any required customer training been completed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If required, has on-site installation been successfully completed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the end of the meeting, the reviewers should make their approval decision. If some of the product acceptance&#xD;
    criteria have not been satisfied, the customer may decide to accept the product conditionally upon certain corrective&#xD;
    actions being taken. In this situation you may choose to initiate a new iteration to deal with the issues arising.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of the Project Acceptance Review can be one of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&#xD;

    &lt;tr>&#xD;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;26%&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;b>Project Accepted&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;>&#xD;
            The customer representative agrees that the project deliverables have satisfied the acceptance criteria, and&#xD;
            the customer takes possession of the delivered product an support materials.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;tr>&#xD;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;26%&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;b>Conditional Acceptance&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;>&#xD;
            The customer representative agrees to accept the results of the project, subject to the completion of specified&#xD;
            corrective actions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;tr>&#xD;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;26%&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;b>Project Not Accepted&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;>&#xD;
            The project fails to achieve the product acceptance criteria, and requires additional work and another project&#xD;
            acceptance cycle to be carried out.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the project is not accepted by the customer, the project team should schedule the corrective actions that have been&#xD;
    identified, and re-submit a revised Iteration Assessment for a follow-up review. In the case of a &quot;Conditional&#xD;
    Acceptance&quot;, this assessment only need confirm that the specified corrective actions have been completed. However, if&#xD;
    the project was &quot;not accepted&quot;, the full suite of product acceptance reviews and tests should be performed.&#xD;

    At the end of the meeting, a Review Record is completed capturing any important discussions or action items, and&#xD;
    recording the result of the Project Acceptance Review. If the result was &quot;not accepted&quot; a follow-up Project Acceptance&#xD;
    Review Meeting should be scheduled for a later date.&#xD;
