                To gain an objective, up-to-date understanding of the general status of the testing work against&#xD;
                plan.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are different ways to approach this step, and much of the approach will depend on your project culture. Where&#xD;
    available, gather and collate progress reports prepared by individual team members or sub-teams. Project time sheets&#xD;
    are another possible source to consider. Where project scheduling systems such as Microsoft Project are actively used&#xD;
    and updated with actual progress this provides another useful information source. Where available and actively used,&#xD;
    you might also derive objective status or progress metrics from configuration and change management systems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For this step and subsequent steps that deal with gathering information and assessing the test effort, try to obtain a&#xD;
    balanced view incorporating both objective and subjective measures. Remember that objective numbers only give part of&#xD;
    the picture and need to be supported and explained by the current project &quot;climate&quot;. Conversely, don't rely purely on&#xD;
    hearsay and subjective speculation about the test effort: look for supporting objective evidence. We recommend you&#xD;
    supplement your objective data by discussion with either team leads or where possible individual team members to gather&#xD;
    subjective assessments and gauge how much confidence you can place in the objective data.&#xD;

    others. Look also for areas where effort may be unproductive or not showing sufficient benefit for the level of effort&#xD;
    being expended.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Look also at the effectiveness of the testing. Look for data that supports your initial observations of effectiveness.&#xD;
    Consider aspects such as defect discovery rate, defect severity counts, duplicate defect statistics, and defects&#xD;
    detected as test escapes.&#xD;

        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify important trends evident in the Change Request data. In general it's less important for this task to spend&#xD;
    time analyzing data volumes and more important to identify what the relative data trends are indicating. Look for&#xD;
    positive signs such as a steady, continuous rate of defect discovery, or a light ongoing increase or decrease in&#xD;
    discovery rate over time. Be on the lookout for sharp peaks and troughs in discovery rate that indicate the test team&#xD;
    may be encountering process, environmental, political or other problems that are reducing their productivity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Look at trends in defects closures. Look for significant increases of closures by development staff as &quot;not&#xD;
    reproducible&quot;; identify cases where this is a result of insufficient analysis of the failure having been performed by&#xD;
    the test team and quantify the extent of this problem. Look at trends in defects being closed by development staff as&#xD;
    &quot;functioning as designed&quot;; identify cases where this is a result of insufficient analysis of the specification having&#xD;
    been performed by the test team and quantify the extent of this problem. Be careful to confirm these indications are&#xD;
    not false and due instead to overworked developers triaging their workload. Some analysis should also be done of defect&#xD;
    verification trends as fixes to defects are released to the test team in subsequent builds: look out for trends that&#xD;
    indicate defects awaiting verification by the test team are aging or growing to an unmanageable number.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Look for other trends that indicate problems. Look at the the way in which defects and other change requests have been&#xD;
    recorded or managed by the test team: ambiguous and insufficient information on a change request is difficult and&#xD;
    frustrating for a developer to take action on. The team should take care to monitor that the quality of the information&#xD;
    recorded against defects remains-on average-relatively high. Take the opportunity to improve the clarity of the&#xD;
    associated Change Requests, eliminating ambiguity and emotive language and reasoning. Work together with the&#xD;
    individuals who created these work products to ensure the essence of the problem is clearly stated and encourage them&#xD;
    to find factual and accurate ways to approach discussing the Issues.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also look out for imbalances in defect distribution on a number of different dimensions. Look for functional areas of&#xD;
    the application or the specification that have low defect counts raised against them: this may indicate an exposure&#xD;
    that insufficient testing has been undertaken in that functional area. Look also at distribution by test team member:&#xD;
    there may be indications that individual team members are overworked and that productivity is suffering.&#xD;

    suggest certain aspects of testing are missing or are no longer of importance: If the requirements or development teams&#xD;

    Present your assessment for stakeholders to comment and offer feedback on. The format or method for doing this will&#xD;
    differ from project to project: in some cases it will be a series of informal conversations, in another simply a&#xD;
    posting on a project intranet web-site, and in others a formal presentation-choose a format that suits your culture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even with the best planning and specification documents possible, there will usually be differences between the&#xD;
    original expectation and intent of those documents and the resulting end product. This is as true for testing and&#xD;
    evaluating software as it is for the software development itself. The value of this step is to take the opportunity to&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Based on your analysis and the feedback you've received from various stakeholders, identify opportunities for&#xD;
    improvement. Look for ways to make the testing more effective, productive and efficient. This might involve:&#xD;
    reassigning staff, including pairing staff to work more effectively or employing specialized contractors; using&#xD;
    productivity tools to improve efficiency; finding alternative approaches and techniques that are more productive in&#xD;
    terms of finding defects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In most cases it's better to make small, incremental improvements to the test effort and avoid the risk of derailing&#xD;
    the project with large, unsettling changes: In some cases a bigger change is warranted and useful. Use your best&#xD;
    judgment to formulate an appropriate approach to improvement and discuss your ideas with other management staff to get&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    For the improvements to be effective, you will need to manage their success. Identify ways that you will be able to&#xD;

    monitor the progress being made in adopting the changes yourself, or appoint someone else on the team to do so.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most changes meet resistance or problems that must be overcome for them to be ultimately successful. Allow time for and&#xD;

&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work was of sufficient value, and that you&#xD;
    did not simply consume vast quantities of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and&#xD;
    that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their&#xD;
    work. Where possible, use the checklists provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people performing the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input take part in reviewing your interim&#xD;
    work. Do this while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate&#xD;
    your work against the key input work products to make sure you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It&#xD;
    may be useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative delivery process and that in many cases work products evolve over time.&#xD;
    As such, it is not usually necessary-and is often counterproductive-to fully-form a work product that will only be&#xD;
    partially used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because there is a high probability&#xD;
    that the situation surrounding the work product will change-and the assumptions made when the work product was created&#xD;
    proven incorrect-before the work product is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid the trap of&#xD;
    spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content value. In project environments where presentation&#xD;
    has importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative resource&#xD;
    to perform presentation tasks.&#xD;
