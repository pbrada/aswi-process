    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Gain Agreement on the Problem Being Solved&quot; name=&quot;Gain Agreement on the Problem Being Solved&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    One of the simplest ways to gain agreement on the definition of the problem, is to write it down and see if everyone&#xD;
    agrees.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ask the group: What is the problem?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is very common to rush headlong into defining the solution, rather than taking time to first understand the&#xD;
        problem. Write down the problem, and see if you can get everyone to agree on the definition.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Then ask the group again: What is the problem, really?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Search for root causes, or the &quot;problem behind the problem&quot;. The real problem is often hiding behind what is&#xD;
        perceived as a problem.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Don't accept the first statement of a problem. Continue to ask &quot;why?&quot; Explore the nature of the problem.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes the group can be so focused on an envisioned solution that it is hard to get them to formulate what the&#xD;
    underlying problem actually is. In such cases, it can be beneficial to explore the benefits of the solution, and then&#xD;
    try to find the problems being solved by those benefits. You can then explore whether or not those problems are &quot;real&quot;&#xD;
    problems in the organization. Common techniques used to find the problem behind the problem are &lt;a&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Identify Stakeholders&quot; name=&quot;Identify Stakeholders&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the domain expertise of the development team, identifying the stakeholders may be a trivial or a&#xD;
    nontrivial step. Often, this simply involves interviewing decision-makers, potential users and other interested&#xD;
    parties. The following questions are helpful:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who are the users of the system?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who is the economic buyer for the system?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who else will be affected by the outputs that the system produces?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who will evaluate and bless the system when it is delivered and deployed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are there any other internal or external users of the system whose needs must be addressed?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Who will maintain the new system?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Is there anyone else?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Okay, is there anyone else?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start to develop profiles of potential (or actual) users of the system.&amp;nbsp; Initial information on key users and&#xD;
    their environment should be documented in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_vision_2D6D6F1.html&quot; guid=&quot;{417F089F-6636-451A-A8AB-AB4EAC7AC4F1}&quot;>Vision&lt;/a>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Define the System Boundaries&quot; name=&quot;Define the System Boundaries&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The system boundary defines the border between the solution and the real world that surrounds the solution. In other&#xD;
    words, the system boundary describes an envelope in which the solution system is contained. Information, in the form of&#xD;
    inputs and outputs, is passed back and forth from the system to the users that live outside of the system. All&#xD;
    interactions with the system occur via interfaces between the system and the external world.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    In many cases, the boundaries of the system are obvious. For example, the boundaries of a single user, shrink-wrap&#xD;
    personal contact manager that runs on Microsoft Windows&amp;reg; are relatively well defined. There is only one user and one&#xD;
    platform. The interfaces between the user and the application consist of the user interface dialogs that the user&#xD;
    accesses to enter information into the system, and any output reports and communication paths that the system uses to&#xD;
    document or transmit the resulting information.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are a variety of sources of constraints to be considered. Following is a list of potential sources and questions&#xD;
    to ask:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Political: Are there internal or external political issues that affect potential solutions? Interdepartmental?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Economic: Which financial or budgetary constraints are applicable? Are there costs of goods sold, or product&#xD;
        pricing considerations? Are there any licensing issues?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Environmental: Are there environmental or regulatory constraints? Legal? Other standards we are restricted by?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Technical: Are we restricted in our choice of technologies? Are we constrained to work within existing platforms or&#xD;
        technologies? Are we prohibited from any new technologies?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Feasibility: Is the schedule defined? Are we restricted to existing resources? Can we use outside labor? Can we&#xD;
        expand resources? Temporary? Permanent?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System: Is the solution to be built on our existing systems? Must we maintain compatibility with existing&#xD;
        solutions? Which operating systems and environments must be supported?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    With the whole group, work on easel charts and fill in the following template for each problem you have identified:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The problem of &amp;lt;describe the problem&amp;gt;&lt;br />&#xD;

     The impact of which is &amp;lt;what is the impact of the problem&amp;gt;.&lt;br />&#xD;
     A successful solution would &amp;lt;list some key benefits of a successful solution&amp;gt;.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this template is to help you distinguish solutions/answers from problems/questions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;b>The problem of:&lt;/b> untimely and improper resolution of customer service issues&lt;br />&#xD;
     &lt;b>affects:&lt;/b> our customers, customer support reps and service technicians.&lt;br />&#xD;
     &lt;b>The impact of which is:&lt;/b> customer dissatisfaction, perceived lack of quality, unhappy employees and loss of&#xD;
    revenue.&lt;b>&lt;br />&#xD;
     A successful solution would:&lt;/b> provide real-time access to a trouble-shooting database by support reps and&#xD;
    facilitate dispatch of service technicians, in a timely manner, only to those locations which genuinely need their&#xD;
    assistance.&#xD;
