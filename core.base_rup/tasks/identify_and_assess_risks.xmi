                To make an inventory of 'what can go wrong' with the project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    To initiate the risk list (in the inception phase):&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Gather the project team together (which at this point should be quite small; if there are more than five to seven&#xD;
    people on the project team, limit the risk assessment process to the activity leaders).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When we identify risks, we consider 'what can go wrong'. At the broadest level, of course, everything can go wrong. The&#xD;
    point is not to cast a pessimistic view on the project, however; we want to identify potential barriers to success so&#xD;
    that we can reduce or eliminate them. For more information, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/risk_list_D1F548EE.html&quot; guid=&quot;9.683880174893527E-305&quot;>Guideline: Risk List&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    More specifically, we are looking for the events which might occur which would decrease the likelihood that we will be&#xD;
    able to deliver the project with the right features, the requisite level of quality, on time and within budget.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using brainstorming techniques, ask each member to identify a project risk. Clarification questions are allowed, but&#xD;
    the risks should not be evaluated or commented on by the group. Go around the table until no more risks can be&#xD;
    identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Involve all parties in this process, and don't worry too much about form or duplicates; you can clean up the list&#xD;
    later. Use homogeneous groups of people (customers, users, technical people, and so on). This eases the process of&#xD;
    collecting risks; individuals are less inhibited in front of their peers (in specialty and hierarchy) than in a large&#xD;
    mix.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make clear to the participants that raising a risk does not equate in any way with volunteering to address the risk. If&#xD;
    there is any sense that raising a risk will result in becoming responsible for addressing the risk, no one will&#xD;
    identify any risks (or the risks they do raise will be trivial).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To prime the pump, try starting with generic risk lists such as &lt;b>Assessment and Control of Software Risks&lt;/b> by&#xD;
    Capers Jones [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html#JON94&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>JON94&lt;/a>] or &lt;b>the Taxonomy-Based Risk Identification&lt;/b> established by the Software&#xD;
    Engineering Institute [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html#CAR93&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>CAR93&lt;/a>]. Circulate&#xD;
    the risk list: seeing what has been already identified often helps people to identify more.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    To update the risk list (in later phases):&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may solicit input as identified above. But generally, based on the example of the existing list, new risks will be&#xD;
    identified by the team members, and captured at the regular project Status Assessment. See &lt;a&#xD;

                To combine similar risks (to reduce the size of the risk list).&lt;br />&#xD;
                 To rank the risks in terms of their impact on the project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When no more risks are being found, look at the risk list as a group to see if there are any natural groupings&#xD;
    (occurrences of the same risk), and combine risks where possible to eliminate duplicates. Sometimes, the risks&#xD;
    identified will be symptoms of some more fundamental risk; in this case, group the related risks together under the&#xD;
    more fundamental risk.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Quantitative risk management techniques recommend that risks be prioritized according to the overall risk exposure the&#xD;
    risk represents to the project. To determine the exposure for each risk the group should estimate the following&#xD;
    information:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;table border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;tr>&#xD;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;26%&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;b>Impact of risk&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;>&#xD;
            The deviations of schedule, effort, or costs from plan if the risk occurs&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;tr>&#xD;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;26%&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;b>Likelihood of Occurrence&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;>&#xD;
            The probability that the risk will actually occur (usually expressed as a percentage)&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;tr>&#xD;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;26%&quot;>&#xD;
            &lt;b>Risk Exposure&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;>&#xD;
            Calculated by multiplying the Impact by the Likelihood of Occurrence&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a group, the exposure of each risk should be derived by consensus. Significant differences of opinion should be&#xD;
    further discussed to see if everyone is interpreting the risk the same way. Typically this information is included as&#xD;
    columns in a tabular &lt;u>Risk List&lt;/u>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is human nature to worry about the highest impact risks, but if these are very unlikely to occur they are really&#xD;
    less important than more moderate risks that are often overlooked. By considering both the magnitude of the risk and&#xD;
    its likelihood of occurrence, this approach helps project managers focus their risk management efforts in areas that&#xD;
    will have the most significant affect on project delivery.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the exposure for each risk has been determined, you can sort the risks in order of decreasing exposure to create&#xD;
    your &quot;top 10&quot; Risks List.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because estimation of likelihood and cost is expensive and risky in itself, it is generally only useful to gauge the&#xD;
    impact of the top 10 to 20 risks. Smaller projects may consider fewer risks, whereas larger projects present a larger&#xD;
    'risk target' and as a result have a larger number of relevant risks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to ranking the risks in descending order of exposure, you may also find it useful to group or cluster the&#xD;
    risks into categories, based on the magnitude of their impact on the project (risk magnitude). In most cases, five&#xD;
    categories is sufficient:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        High&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Significant&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Moderate&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Minor&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Low&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document the risks and circulate them among the project team members.&#xD;

        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While not always possible, sometimes you can side-step risks altogether. Often risk is caused by poor system scope; if&#xD;
    you can reduce the scope of the system (by eliminating non-essential requirements), whole sections of the risk list go&#xD;
    tumbling off with the dropped requirements. Not the least of these risks is that of not having enough resources&#xD;
    (including time) to do the work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In other cases, technology can be acquired to reduce the risk of building particular functionality, a form of risk&#xD;
    avoidance in which one set of risks (that of building the technology) is exchanged for another (that of being dependent&#xD;
    upon forces outside one's control).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Finally risk can be transferred to other organizations.&#xD;

            &lt;td width=&quot;95%&quot;>&#xD;
                To develop plans to mitigate risks, that is to reduce their impact of the risks.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For direct risks, that is,&amp;nbsp; risks for which the project has some degree of control, identify what actions will be&#xD;
    taken to reduce the probability of the risk, or to reduce its impact on the project (the mitigation strategies).&#xD;
    Typically, the risk itself derives from lack of information; often, the mitigation strategy itself is one of&#xD;
    investigating the topic further the reduce the uncertainty.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are risks for which some action can be taken to either make the risk materialize or retire it. In an iterative&#xD;
    development process, allocate such actions to early iterations to mitigate the risk as early as possible. Confront the&#xD;
    risks as early as possible. If a risk is in the form &quot;X may not function as planned?&quot;, then plan to try X as soon as&#xD;
    possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Examples:&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To reduce the risk that products X and Y cannot be integrated, a prototype will be built to investigate the&#xD;
        difficulty of integration. The following features (enumerate in a list) will be tested to ensure the integration is&#xD;
        successful.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To reduce the risk that Database A will not perform adequately, it will be benchmarked using a suite of tests which&#xD;
        model the workload of the target application.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To reduce the risk that test tool Z will not be able to effectively regression test the application, we will&#xD;
        acquire and use it during the upcoming iteration.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of these actions should be to reduce the probability that certain risks will occur, perhaps to near zero. In&#xD;
    cases where the risk is confirmed, the risk is responded to with a contingency plan (See &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;#Identify%20Risk%20Response%20Strategies&quot;>Identify Contingency Strategies&lt;/a>).&#xD;

    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each risk, whether you have a plan to actively mitigate it or not, you must decide what actions are to be taken&#xD;
    when or if the risk materializes, that is, if it becomes a problem, a 'loss event' in insurance jargon. This is&#xD;
    commonly called &quot;a plan 'B'&quot; or contingency plan. A contingency plan is needed when risk avoidance and risk transfer&#xD;
    have failed, mitigation was not that successful, and now the risk must be addressed head-on. This is very often the&#xD;
    case for indirect risks, that is, the risks for which the project has no control, or when the mitigation strategies are&#xD;
    too costly to implement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The contingency plan should consider:&#xD;

&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Identify Risk Indicators&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some risks can be monitored using project metrics, looking at trends and threshold; for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rework remaining too high&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Breakage remaining too high&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Actual expenditure far above plans&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some risks can be monitored based on project requirements and test results; for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Response times one order of magnitude above requirement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some risks are associated to specific event; for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software component not delivered in time by third party.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are many other, &quot;softer&quot; indicators, none of which will fully diagnose the problem. For example, there is always&#xD;
    a risk that morale will drop (in fact, at certain points in the project, this is almost (predictable). There are a&#xD;
    number of indicators: grumbling, &quot;gallows humor&quot;, missed deadlines, poor quality, and so on. No one of these &quot;measures&quot;&#xD;
    is a sure indicator; joking about the futility of a particular deliverable can be a healthy way of relieving stress,&#xD;
    but if it continues, it may be an indication that the team feels an increasing sense of impending doom.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Listen to all indicators without passing judgment. It is easy to label the bearer of 'bad news' as someone who has a&#xD;
    bad attitude; behind cynicism there is often more than a grain of truth. Often, the 'bearer of bad news' is acting as&#xD;
    the 'conscience of the project'. Most people want the project to succeed, and they feel frustrated when momentum is&#xD;
    carrying the project in the other direction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Identify &quot;Loss&quot; Actions, or &quot;Plan B&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For simple cases, the contingency plan enumerates alternate solutions. The impact is usually costs and delays to scrap&#xD;
    the current solution and implement the new one.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For other, &quot;softer&quot; risks is often not one action to take when a loss has occurred, but several. When morale drops, for&#xD;
    example, it is best to acknowledge the condition and gather as a group to discuss the prevailing attitudes on the&#xD;
    project. Listen to concerns, identify issues, and generally let people vent. After an appropriate amount of venting,&#xD;
    though, move on to address the causes of concern. Use the risk list as a way to focus the discussion. Translate the&#xD;
    concerns into a concrete action plan by reprioritizing risks and then reformulating the iteration plans to&#xD;
    systematically address the top risks. Positive action has a stronger effect than positive (but empty) words.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Despite the mood at the time, a loss occurrence has a positive side: it forces action. Too often it is easy to postpone&#xD;
    risks by ignoring them, lulled into complacency by the apparent quiet. When a loss event occurs, action is required.&#xD;
    The risk is no longer a risk, there is no longer any uncertainty about its occurrence.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Yet a loss occurrence is also a failure to avoid or mitigate risk. It should force a re-examination of the risk list to&#xD;
    determine whether the project team may have some systematic blind-spots. As difficult as frank self-assessment is, it&#xD;
    may prevent other problems later on.&#xD;

&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Risk assessment is actually a continuous process, rather than one which occurs only at specific intervals during the&#xD;
    project. At minimum, you should:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Revisit your list weekly to see what has changed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make the top ten items visible to the whole project and insist on action being taken on them. Often you would&#xD;
        attach the current risk list to your Status Assessment reports.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the end of an iteration, refocus on the goals of the iteration with respect to the risk list. Specifically:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Eliminate risks that have been fully mitigated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Introduce new risks recently discovered.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reassess the magnitude and reorder the risk list (see &lt;a href=&quot;#Analyze%20and%20Prioritize%20Risks&quot;>Analyze and&#xD;
        Prioritize Risks&lt;/a>).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do not be too concerned if you discover that the list of risk grows during the inception and elaboration phases. As&#xD;
    project members do the work, they realize that something they thought was trivial actually contains risks. As you begin&#xD;
    doing integration, you may find some hidden difficulty. However the risks should steadily decrease as the project&#xD;
    reaches the end of elaboration and during construction. If not, you may not be handling risks appropriately or your&#xD;
    system is too complex, or impossible to build in a systematic and predictable fashion. For more information see &lt;a&#xD;
