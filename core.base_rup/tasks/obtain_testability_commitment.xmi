    Study the testability needs and perform basic impact analysis in terms of the impact on the test effort of not having&#xD;
    the need met. Also consider some basic analysis of the potential effort required by the development team to investigate&#xD;
    and provide a solution for the need. For each need, identify potential alternative solutions that would have less&#xD;
    impact the development teams.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using this information, formulate a prioritized list that places foremost the needs that have a large impact on the&#xD;
    test effort if they are not met, yet have no alternative solution. Do this to both avoid wasting valuable development&#xD;
    resources on less essential testability needs, saving this opportunity for the really important ones.&#xD;

        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By asking the development team to develop software with specific provision for the test effort, you will be adding&#xD;
    further requirements and constraints to the development effort; that essentially equates to more work and additional&#xD;
    risk and complexity for the development team. Some development teams will view designing for testability as outside the&#xD;
    scope of their responsibility. In other cases, the testability needs will have to compete for the development resources&#xD;
    against customer needs and requirements that will usually be given more priority. As such, you need to &quot;sell&quot; the&#xD;
    benefits of the testability needs to the project manager, software architect and other development team stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Formulate an analysis of the benefits of each testability need you want to obtain commitment for. Research papers,&#xD;
    article and studies that support the value of your testability need, and make use of ROI statistics where available.&#xD;
    Think of the benefits in terms of the value provided to the development team; what useful evaluation information will&#xD;
    you be able to provide to them that could not be provided without this need being met? How will this make it easier or&#xD;
    more efficient for you to give the development team timely, accurate, in-depth or useful feedback during each build&#xD;
    cycle? Does this need provide the development team with a useful feature that can be used in their own test effort or&#xD;
    in future diagnosis of software failure? In the case of competition against customer needs, consider ways you can show&#xD;
    that providing a solution to the testability need earlier will provide additional opportunities for customer&#xD;
    requirements to be supported in subsequent build cycles.&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Given that you will be imposing potentially additional work or risk on the development team, you should identify and&#xD;
    engage with those influential stakeholders who have the ability to approve or mandate the support of testability. Do&#xD;
    this as soon as possible, before actively promoting the testability needs you want supported.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The three most important stakeholders are the software architect, the project manager and the customer representative.&#xD;
    Spend time with the software architect and promote the value of creating a software architecture that supports&#xD;
    testability. Spend time with the project manager and promote the benefits of testability in terms of test team&#xD;
    productivity and fast turn around on evaluation information. Encourage the customer to place value on a quality product&#xD;
    being delivered.&#xD;

            &lt;td width=&quot;95%&quot;>&#xD;
                To inform the relevant stakeholders of the important testability needs of the test effort, and gain their&#xD;
                support for testability.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's important to promote testability needs in the right way. Each combination of project manager, development team and&#xD;
    customer stakeholders has a different social dynamic and culture, and it's important to be sensitive to that when you&#xD;
    promote testability needs. As general heuristics, don't mount a formal testability &quot;campaign&quot; if the team is relatively&#xD;
    laid-back and informal; and don't use an informal approach in a high-ceremony project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases, a collaborative &quot;brainstorming&quot; session is a useful presentation format, where the need is presented as&#xD;
    a challenge to the development team, and they are encouraged to identify creative solutions to meet the testability&#xD;
    need(s). This encourages their ownership of the solution and fosters a feeling of partnership in the effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Timing is also important for this step. As a general rule, you should try to identify and promote the most important&#xD;
    testability issues as early as possible, generally during the Elaboration, and where possible the Inception phase. When&#xD;
    testability issues are raised in these early stages of the project, the team is typically smaller and is more receptive&#xD;
    to change. It's also easier to include these needs in the evolving design as minimal rework is usually required.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good place to identify testability needs and present them in a positive and less &quot;official&quot; manner is to have the&#xD;
    test team offer their services in evaluating proof-of-concept activities and in evaluating the selection of third-party&#xD;
    components for use in the development effort. In particular, the involvement of test teams during database component&#xD;
    selection, UI control or component selection, middleware components etc. means that testability issues can be used as&#xD;
    one aspect of the component selection criteria. For example, in many cases development teams will have minimal concern&#xD;
    over which UI widget library to make use of; if one library is more testable than another, the development team will be&#xD;
    happy to select the more testable widget library.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you've had trouble identifying or engaging with testability champions, you may need to consider either an approach&#xD;
    that introduces the changes more incrementally making them potentially less risky and smaller blocks of effort, or you&#xD;
    may have to escalate the most important testability needs as critical project issues that prevent the test effort from&#xD;
    being successful until they are resolved. In the latter case, we recommend you carefully consider all your options&#xD;
    before deciding on this course of action.&#xD;

            &lt;td width=&quot;95%&quot;>&#xD;
                To gain an agreement that the development team will continue to support and maintain testability&#xD;

        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's important to ensure the testability needs are regarded in the same way as any other requirement or constraint&#xD;
    placed on the development effort. You need to be assured that the testability features made available today will not be&#xD;
    abandoned tomorrow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases, attempting to gain this commitment may result in the development team refusing to develop or support the&#xD;
    testability needs. While this can be disheartening, it's better to be aware of this situation and deal with the reality&#xD;
    of it at as early as possible; it's much worse to have spent extensive time and effort developing a test implementation&#xD;
    that the development team then abandon uncommitted support for.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    While the development team may agree to provide the necessary support for the testability needs of the test effort,&#xD;
    it's important that you take an active interest in the design, implementation and completion of this work. Don't simply&#xD;
    abandon concern because the development team have agreed to address the testability needs or have begun work on a&#xD;
    solution; you need to ensure that an appropriate solution is developed in a timely manner.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make yourself and the other test team staff readily available to answer the development teams questions, and offer to&#xD;
    evaluate the prototypes as soon as they are built. Offer constructive feedback and show enthusiasm for the effort the&#xD;
    development team have put into helping meet your needs. Offer to have your key staff attend or facilitate design&#xD;
    workshops for the more complex testability needs, but guard against your team being overbearing and controlling the&#xD;
    solution space of the design process for the developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where issues arise and you feel they are not getting adequate attention, or being addressed with the necessary haste,&#xD;
    raise your concerns with the software architect and project manager. Have the project manager log an issue on the&#xD;
    project issue list if appropriate.&#xD;

    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work was of sufficient value, and that you&#xD;
    did not simply consume vast quantities of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and&#xD;
    that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their&#xD;
    work. Where possible, use the checklists provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people performing the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input take part in reviewing your interim&#xD;
    work. Do this while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate&#xD;
    your work against the key input work products to make sure you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It&#xD;
    may be useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative delivery process and that in many cases work products evolve over time.&#xD;
    As such, it is not usually necessary-and is often counterproductive-to fully-form a work product that will only be&#xD;
    partially used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because there is a high probability&#xD;
    that the situation surrounding the work product will change-and the assumptions made when the work product was created&#xD;
    proven incorrect-before the work product is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid the trap of&#xD;
    spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content value. In project environments where presentation&#xD;
    has importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative resource&#xD;
    to perform presentation tasks.&#xD;
