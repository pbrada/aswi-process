&lt;p>&#xD;
    The final acceptance of a project's deliverables by the customer is often the source of some friction in software&#xD;
    projects. This is usually the result of a mismatch between the customers view of how the product is supposed to&#xD;
    function, and the methods used to assess the products compliance with the stated requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    By jointly writing a Product Acceptance Plan during the Inception Phase, the customer and the project team can avoid&#xD;
    this situation, by agreeing on a pre-defined process and set of criteria by which the product will be assessed for&#xD;
    acceptance. This helps the project team build a product the customer can accept, and helps set the customer's&#xD;
    expectations for how the product should perform. The Product Acceptance Plan also specifies how problems identified by&#xD;
    the customer during product acceptance will be addressed.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Define Customer and Project Responsibilities&quot; name=&quot;Define Customer and Project Responsibilities&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first step is to explicitly identify which parts of product acceptance process will be the responsibility of the&#xD;
    customer and which will be the responsibility of the project team. You should also explicitly identify the individual&#xD;
    or group who will make the final acceptance decision. Responsibilities can include such things as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Delivery/pick-up of software and documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Installation of hardware/software test platforms&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provision of test data&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Provision of resources to conduct the acceptance tests&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Timely turn-around of acceptance test results&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_YSJJUdnnEdmO6L4XMImrsA" name=" Document the Product Acceptance Criteria " guid="_YSJJUdnnEdmO6L4XMImrsA">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Document the Product Acceptance Criteria&quot; name=&quot;Document the Product Acceptance Criteria&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The product acceptance criteria are defined and agreed during the Task: Initiate Project during the Inception Phase and&#xD;
    should be captured in the Product Acceptance Plan at that time. During the Elaboration Phase, the criteria can be&#xD;
    expended in greater detail when specific tests reviews can be identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These criteria should be developed jointly by the customer organization and the project team, and may include the&#xD;
    following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Delivery of all work products identified as deliverable to the customer&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        List of required participants for acceptance testing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Required test location(s)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Successful completion of the work product evaluations identified in the Product Acceptance Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Successful completion of customer training&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Successful completion of on-site installation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measures that will identify to what extent original project specifications have been met&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measures that will identify to what extent the objectives of the business case have been met&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Identify Artifacts and Evaluation MEthods&quot; name=&quot;Identify Artifacts and Evaluation MEthods&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Next, identify which project work products are to be delivered to the customer for acceptance. For each of these you&#xD;
    need to identify the evaluation method(s) that will be used to ensure the work product meets the specified acceptance&#xD;
    criteria. Later in the project, detailed review checklists and test cases will be developed to provide step-by-step&#xD;
    instructions on how these evaluations will be carried out.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Identify Required Resources&quot; name=&quot;Identify Required Resources&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the numbers and types of work product evaluations have been identified, identify in the plan all the necessary&#xD;
    resources that will be required to conduct the product acceptance task. You should include in your list of resources:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Personnel&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Computer hardware&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Data&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documentation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Any specialized equipment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Define Product Acceptance Schedule&quot; name=&quot;Define Product Acceptance Schedule&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another common problem with the product acceptance process is where the customer places insufficient priority on the&#xD;
    acceptance task, with the result that the process drags out over a long period of time. It is a good idea to include in&#xD;
    you Product Acceptance Plan a schedule detailing when the various acceptance evaluation tasks are to occur. This&#xD;
    schedule will become &quot;rolled up&quot; into the master project schedule in the Software Development Plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Define Problem Resolution Process&quot; name=&quot;Define Problem Resolution Process&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This final step is also very important. Should problems arise during the acceptance evaluations, it is a very good idea&#xD;
    to have an agreed process to follow. Typically this would simply follow the projects problem resolution process as&#xD;
    defined in the Problem Resolution Plan. However is is also helpful to cover off issues such how to reach agreement that&#xD;
    a problem is real, the provision of funding for additional work by the project team, or contractual penalties. By&#xD;
    agreeing all these things up front with the customer, you will greatly smooth out the end of your project.&#xD;
