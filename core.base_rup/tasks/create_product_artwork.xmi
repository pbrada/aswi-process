  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A graphic artist should be aware of both the creative and technical aspects of producing product artwork.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &amp;nbsp;A graphic artist's creativity comes into play when deciding on the look and layout of product artwork, and how it&#xD;
    will look on the box taking into account all the folds, flaps, thickness, and how the colors might &quot;bleed&quot;. In the case&#xD;
    of creating a Web site, the graphic artist's concern will be the image area,&amp;nbsp; visual appeal, and navigability of&#xD;
    the product site or set of pages.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Technically, the graphic artist needs to be aware of the production process followed to create the product artwork. The&#xD;
    deliverables to the manufacturer are going to be different if the artwork is going to be created using silk screening&#xD;
    versus delivering a set of camera-ready graphics files that may have been scanned in 4-colors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>Artwork should reinforce&amp;nbsp; product branding standards, established by the company's marketing group, to create the&#xD;
appropriate messaging for the consumer.</keyConsiderations>
