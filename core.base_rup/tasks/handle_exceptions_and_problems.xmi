    A Status Assessment is created in the regularly scheduled Report Status task. Each Status Assessment identifies any&#xD;
    &lt;b>problems&lt;/b> or &quot;things gone wrong&quot;. These can be project problems (e.g. deviations from plans, personnel), product&#xD;
    problems (defects, requirements ambiguities, technology deficiencies), and realized risks. The Status Assessment also&#xD;
    identifies any &lt;b>exceptions&lt;/b> that occur. Exceptions can be thought of as issues that are barriers to project&#xD;
    progress (e.g. availability of equipment, availability of key individuals to answer questions, difficulty getting a&#xD;
    decision made). The Project Manager also maintains an Issues List, which is maintained more or less continuously and so&#xD;
    is usually more current than the Status Assessment. These are the means of recording and tracking the issues that are&#xD;
    the stimulus for this task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager invokes the Handle Exceptions and Problems task to address any problems or issues as they become&#xD;
    known.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first step is to evaluate each of the problems/issues identified in the Status Assessment and Issues List. Most&#xD;
    projects run a regular (often weekly) &quot;Issues Meeting&quot; for this purpose attended by the project manager, software&#xD;
    architect and team leads. For each problem/issue you need to identify the cause, its impact on the project, and&#xD;
    determine what your options are to resolve it. You should also determine if the possible solutions are within the&#xD;
    authority of the project team to implement.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Determine Appropriate Corrective Actions&quot; name=&quot;Determine Appropriate Corrective Actions&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Next, for each problem/exception, select the preferred approach for resolution and determine the steps you need to take&#xD;
    to implement it. If this approach will require a change to the Software Development Plan or the product's requirements&#xD;
    or design, you will need to create a Change Request and implement the change following the project's Configuration&#xD;
    Management Plan. If the approach does not change one of the baselined plans then the solution can be implemented by the&#xD;
    project manager issuing a new Work Order. In either case, if the preferred solution is beyond the authority of the&#xD;
    project team the issue should be escalated to the Project Review Authority for resolution. For example, if the Project&#xD;
    Manager has determined that, without corrective action, the current iteration will not meet its planned end date, the&#xD;
    preferred course of action is to re-scope the iteration (because iterations are &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/timeboxing_109B588A.html&quot; guid=&quot;_yYy-k9nmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>timeboxed&lt;/a>): if&#xD;
    this impacts something that is deliverable to the customer at the end of the iteration, then it should not be done&#xD;
    unilaterally by the project team.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Issue Change Requests and/or Work Orders&quot; name=&quot;Issue Change Requests and/or Work Orders&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the corrective action for each problem or exception has been determined, and any necessary approvals, the project&#xD;
    manager documents the work involved and raises Change Requests and/or Work Orders to initiate the work. The project&#xD;
    manager is often able to retire issues from the Issues List at this point, because the closure will be tracked by other&#xD;
    means.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
