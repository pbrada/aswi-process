    The audience for most of the training materials are the students in a class.&amp;nbsp; However, instructor guidelines may&#xD;
    also be needed.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine the audience for the training. What kind of roles would a typical course attendant have in his or her&#xD;
    organization. What pre-requisites would be required of those who attend the course.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define objectives for the training. What specific features of the product should the students learn about? In many&#xD;
    cases it is not possible to fit all details of the usage of a product into one training session. What level of&#xD;
    knowledge should the students achieve? Some things may be sufficient to discuss at an introduction level, while others&#xD;
    are critical and you need to make sure the students feel comfortable applying them directly after the course.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Discuss what type of training would be suitable. Options to consider are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        On-line tutorials.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Class room training.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workshop-style training.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Decide the duration of the training and what the upper limit for number of attendants should be. It might also be&#xD;
    necessary to develop a family of courses, rather than just one course, to be able to meet the needs of the audience.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine how the materials should be produced. This task is often outsourced.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The primary components of training materials to focus on are the ones the students will use in class. If you are&#xD;
    developing class room or workshop-style training this would include slides and any exercise materials you need.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If your training materials are intended to be used by other people than just the author of the class, you also need to&#xD;
    produce instructor guidelines as well as instructions for how to produce the materials.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the topic of the class, it may also be useful to include a list of references to books, articles,&#xD;
    web-sites that provide the background information for the class. In some cases you may even choose to include re-prints&#xD;
    of reference materials in the student hand outs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To ensure good quality of the training materials, the author of the class may involve an &quot;advisory board&quot; to review the&#xD;
    materials and discuss particular issues. Such a group could include representatives for users, marketing, and&#xD;
    developers of the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
