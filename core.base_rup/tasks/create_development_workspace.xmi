  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Being a member of a project team is knowing what you can work on, and where to deliver the work so that it can be&#xD;
    integrated and tested with the work done by others in the team. A project will typically have one shared work area, and&#xD;
    multiple private development areas. The private development workspace allows a developer to work on tasks in isolation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A developer joins a project, and in doing so has access to particular work products, and an integration workspace. The&#xD;
    next step is for the developers to create a private development workspace and populate it with the contents of the&#xD;
    project baseline as a basis from which to proceed. The project baseline is created by the Configuration Manager in&#xD;
    setting up the project CM environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Within the development workspace, developers perform tasks to work on work products. The work order provides a&#xD;
    description for what a team member needs to do. They can share their work with others in the project team by delivering&#xD;
    the changed set of work products into the project's shared work area.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the shared work area individual work is integrated with that of other team members. Periodically, a new baseline is&#xD;
    created in the shared work area that incorporates the delivered work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developers update their private development workspaces to include the set of versions represented by the new baseline.&#xD;
    Periodically, as the quality and stability of baselines improve, the promotion level attribute of the baselines is&#xD;
    changed to reflect the appropriate level of maturity. Example baseline attributes are built, tested or release; these&#xD;
    are determined as part of the project CM policies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &amp;nbsp;A development workspace is a private development area that provides an environment in which a team member can&#xD;
        make changes to work products without the changes becoming immediately visible to other team members.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Part of creating a workspace is composing a view that is configured to ensure that any team member can 'get at' the&#xD;
        required version of any given work product they need to do their work. Project policies determine which work&#xD;
        products are visible or modifiable by whom.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
