&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Quality Assurance Plan is a composite document which contains all the information necessary to carry out the&#xD;
    quality assurance tasks for the project. While much of the information referenced by the Quality Assurance Plan is also&#xD;
    referenced in the Software Development Plan, it is still important to develop both plans because they have a different&#xD;
    purpose.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Quality Assurance Plan is used to plan a program of reviews and audits that will check that the defined project&#xD;
    process is being followed correctly, as defined by the various supporting plans that it references. It can be thought&#xD;
    of as the &quot;quality view&quot; of the project's plans, whereas the Software Development Plan presents a &quot;delivery view&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this task, the Project Manager defines and/or reviews the Quality Assurance program for appropriateness and&#xD;
    acceptability, and coordinates with the developers of the referenced plans.&#xD;

name=&quot;Ensure Quality Objectives are Defined for the Project&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager may not necessarily define the quality goals for the project, but ensures that these definitions&#xD;
    are created and agreed by the customer, and captured ultimately in the Software Requirements Specification. The&#xD;
    developing organization may also have a standard set of quality goals, in a quality policy statement, which can form&#xD;
    the basis for these definitions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where possible, these objectives should be described in measurable terms. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Zero known severity 1 defects&quot; (...and include a definition of a severity 1 defect)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Maximum 3 second response time&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;User can pick up software and begin entering account information within 1 hour&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Define QA Roles and Responsibilities&quot; name=&quot;Define QA Roles and Responsibilities&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The next step is to define the organization, roles and responsibilities that will participate in these tasks. This&#xD;
    should include the reporting channel for the results of Quality Assurance reviews. In many situations, the Quality&#xD;
    Assurance task should submit its reports directly to the Project Review Authority. The Rational Unified Process&#xD;
    recommends that the Software Engineering Process Authority (SEPA) should have responsibility for the process aspects of&#xD;
    quality, and perform process reviews and audits, as well as ensuring the proper planning and conduct of the review&#xD;
    events described in the Review and Audit section of the Quality Assurance Plan.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Quality Assurance Plan also references a number of other plans describing project standards and how various&#xD;
    supporting process (e.g. configuration management) to be handled. This information is used to help determine the types&#xD;
    of Quality Assurance reviews that will be done, and their frequency. The referenced plans would normally include the&#xD;
    following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documentation Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measurement Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risk Management Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Problem Resolution Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Configuration Management Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software Development Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Subcontractor Management Plan&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the tasks of Quality Assurance. Typically these reviews would include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Audit/review of project plans to ensure they follow the defined delivery process for the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Audit/review of project to ensure the work performed is following the project plans.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Approval of deviations from the standard organizational project processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process improvement assessments&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Review Authority and Project Manager together determine the schedule for Quality Assurance reviews and&#xD;
    audits, and the schedule is captured in the project and iteration plan, which may then be referenced from the Quality&#xD;
    Assurance Plan. The contract may also allow the customer to request audits.&#xD;
