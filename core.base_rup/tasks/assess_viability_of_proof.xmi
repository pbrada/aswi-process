&lt;p>&#xD;
    The criteria against which the Architectural Proof-of-Concept is to be evaluated are drawn from the architecturally&#xD;
    significant requirements, which were the drivers in its construction.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this step, the Architectural Proof-of-Concept is tested against the evaluation criteria: the way in which this is&#xD;
    done will depend on the form of the proof-of-concept. For example, in the case of an executable prototype, this may be&#xD;
    through demonstration; in the case of a conceptual model, through inspection and reasoning, or, for a simulation,&#xD;
    requiring the set-up and running of the simulation model with input data derived from the evaluation criteria, then the&#xD;
    collection and analysis of output data from the model.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Assess Results&quot; name=&quot;Assess Results&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The results from the evaluation are assessed to determine not only if the architecturally significant requirements can&#xD;
    be satisfied, but also as a check on the validity of those requirements. At this time in the development, requirements&#xD;
    are still mutable, and not necessarily well-understood by the stakeholders; for example, perhaps the opportunity exists&#xD;
    to relax requirements that were shown to be high-risk by the evaluation of the Architectural Proof-of-Concept. All&#xD;
    these avenues should be thoroughly explored in assessing the results - this contrasts with the situation later in&#xD;
    elaboration and construction, when there will be much greater reluctance to change or reinterpret requirements. After&#xD;
    the assessment, with a better understanding of scope and feasibility by all stakeholders, change proposals to the&#xD;
    Business Case, Vision and Risk List are prepared, if necessary.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to the above concerns, answering the following questions can also be useful:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How does the prototype stack-up against&amp;nbsp;its original&amp;nbsp;goals and expected schedule&amp;nbsp;?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How does the design of the prototype compare against the Architecture baseline?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What is our new understanding of the project risks (whether or not they were directly addressed by the prototype)?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
