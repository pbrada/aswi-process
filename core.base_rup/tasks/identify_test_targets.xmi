&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the Iteration Plan and other available sources, identify the individual software items that the development team&#xD;
    plan to produce for the forthcoming Iteration. Where the development effort is distributed to teams in various&#xD;
    locations, you may need to discuss the development plans with each team directly. Check to see whether any development&#xD;
    is subcontracted and use whatever channels are available to you to gather details of the subcontractors development&#xD;
    effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As well as new software, also note changes to infrastructure and shared components. These changes may effect other&#xD;
    dependent or associated software elements produced in previous development cycles, making it necessary to test the&#xD;
    effect of these changes on those elements. For similar reasons, you should identify any changes and additions to&#xD;
    third-party components that the development effort intends to make use of. This includes shared components, base or&#xD;
    common code libraries, GUI widgets, persistence utilities etc. Review the the software architecture to determine what&#xD;
    mechanism are in use that may be effected by third-party component changes.&#xD;

                To identify target items that the testing effort should exercise.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each identified test motivator, examine the list of software items to delivered as part this development cycle.&#xD;
    Make an initial list that excludes any items that cannot be justified as useful in terms of satisfying the test&#xD;
    motivators. Remember to include commercially-available software as well as that to be developed directly by the project&#xD;
    development team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You will also need to consider what impact the various target deployment environments will have on the elements to be&#xD;
    tested. Your list of candidate system elements should be expanded to include both the software being developed and the&#xD;
    candidate elements of the target environment. These elements will include hardware devices, device-driver software,&#xD;
    operating systems, network and communications software, third-party base software components (e.g. eMail client&#xD;
    software, Internet Browsers, etc.). They also include various configurations and settings related to the possible&#xD;
    combinations of all these elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where you have identified important target deployment environments, you should consider recording this information by&#xD;
    creating or updating one or more outlined Test Environment Configurations; this outline should provide a name, brief&#xD;
    description and enumerate the main requirements or features of the configuration. Avoid spending a lot of time on these&#xD;
    outlines; the list of requirements and features will be subsequently detailed in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

            &lt;td width=&quot;95%&quot;>&#xD;
                To eliminate unnecessary targets from-and add missing elements to-the test effort work plan.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Using the evaluation mission and scope of the test effort agreed with the evaluation stakeholders, examine the list of&#xD;
    target items and identify items that do not satisfy the evaluation mission and are obviously out of the test effort&#xD;
    scope.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As an opposing check, critically examine the items again and challenge whether the evaluation mission and test effort&#xD;
    scope will really be satisfied by the refined list of target items. It may be necessary to add additional elements to&#xD;
    the list of target items to ensure appropriate scope and the ability to achieve the evaluation mission.&#xD;

        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now that you've decided on the target test items, you need to communicate your choices to the test team and other&#xD;
    stakeholders in the test effort. Arguably the most common method is to document the decisions about the target items in&#xD;
    the Iteration Test Plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An alternative is to simply record this information in some form of table or spreadsheet and make use of it to govern&#xD;
    work and responsibility assignment. During test implementation and execution individual testers will make use of this&#xD;
    information to make tactical decisions regarding the specific tests to implement, and what test results to capture in&#xD;
    relation to these target items.&#xD;

            &lt;td width=&quot;95%&quot;>&#xD;
                To verify that the task has been completed appropriately and that the resulting work products are&#xD;
                acceptable.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work was of sufficient value, and that you&#xD;
    did not simply consume vast quantities of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and&#xD;
    that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their&#xD;
    work. Where possible, use the checklists provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people performing the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input take part in reviewing your interim&#xD;
    work. Do this while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate&#xD;
    your work against the key input work products to make sure you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It&#xD;
    may be useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative delivery process and that in many cases work products evolve over time.&#xD;
    As such, it is not usually necessary-and is often counterproductive-to fully-form a work product that will only be&#xD;
    partially used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because there is a high probability&#xD;
    that the situation surrounding the work product will change-and the assumptions made when the work product was created&#xD;
    proven incorrect-before the work product is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid the trap of&#xD;
    spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content value. In project environments where presentation&#xD;
    has importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative resource&#xD;
    to perform presentation tasks.&#xD;
