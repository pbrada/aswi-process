    The Iteration Acceptance Review is a formal review between the project team and a customer representative. The&#xD;
    objective of the review is to reach agreement that each of the iteration evaluation criteria has been satisfied, and&#xD;
    that the project is ready to proceed with the next iteration.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Iteration Acceptance Review meeting is a meeting between a customer representative and the project's management&#xD;
    team (the project manager, plus the team leads for the various functional areas of the project team). Representative(s)&#xD;
    of the Project Review Authority may also be involved.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the attendees of the meeting have been identified, set a date/time for the meeting to take place. It is important&#xD;
    that you provide sufficient lead time to allow the participants to review the materials that will be used as the basis&#xD;
    for the approval decision.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Prior to the meeting, distribute the Iteration Assessment to the reviewers. Make sure it is sent out sufficiently in&#xD;
    advance of the meeting to allow the reviewers adequate time to review it.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    During the meeting, the attendees review the iteration evaluation criteria (as documented in the Iteration Plan), and&#xD;
    the results of the Assess Iteration task (as documented in the Iteration Assessment).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For each of the criteria the group should determine and agree whether or not the test and review results&#xD;
        demonstrated that the requirements of each criterion have been met.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the requirements of a criterion have not been satisfied, the group should identify the corrective actions&#xD;
        required in order to achieve compliance.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the end of the meeting, the reviewers should make their approval decision. If some of the iteration criteria have&#xD;
    not been satisfied, the group may still decide to accept the iteration and defer any corrective actions into the next&#xD;
    iteration. You might take this approach if the deficiencies were minor. However, you might also defer corrective&#xD;
    actions if the deficiencies were very significant (e.g. failure of a chosen technology infrastructure) and required a&#xD;
    significant change of approach in the project. In this situation you would initiate a new iteration to deal with the&#xD;
    issues arising.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of the Iteration Acceptance Review can be one of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

            Iteration Accepted &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;>&#xD;
            The customer representative and the project team agree that the deliverables for this iteration are&#xD;
            satisfactory, and the project should proceed to the next iteration.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;tr>&#xD;
        &lt;th scope=&quot;row&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; width=&quot;26%&quot;>&#xD;
            Iteration Not Accepted &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/th>&#xD;
        &lt;td width=&quot;74%&quot;>&#xD;
            The evaluation criteria have not been achieved, and corrective actions are required before the work of the&#xD;
            iteration can be considered complete.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        &lt;/td>&#xD;
    &lt;/tr>&#xD;
&lt;/table>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the iteration is not accepted, the project team should schedule the corrective actions that have been identified,&#xD;
    and re-submit a revised Iteration Assessment for a follow-up review.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the end of the meeting, a Review Record is completed capturing any important discussions or action items, and&#xD;
    recording the result of the Iteration Acceptance Review. If the result was &quot;not accepted&quot; a follow-up Iteration&#xD;
    Acceptance Review Meeting should be scheduled for a later date.&#xD;
