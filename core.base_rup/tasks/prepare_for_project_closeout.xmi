    expectation is that there remain no problems that will preclude formal acceptance, and that any issues that do remain&#xD;
    are documented and handed over for resolution to the customer or other maintenance organization. A final &lt;a&#xD;

    Acceptance Review&lt;/a> , if you have one: The customer should acknowledge that all deliverables - product,&#xD;
    documentation, supporting environment, etc. - and tasks, such as installation and training, have been completed&#xD;
    according to the contract and its supporting plans. If the customer does not give this acceptance, then there may have&#xD;
    to be another iteration to resolve the issues that block acceptance.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The outline of the required tasks already exists in the Project Close-Out Plan section of the Software Development&#xD;
    Plan. This was prepared early in the project and will probably need to be updated at this time. The Project Manager&#xD;
    should ensure that a formal schedule for project termination tasks is constructed and agreed with the customer and the&#xD;
    project's own organization. This schedule should be captured in the Software Development Plan.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A post-mortem review is held to determine whether the project is ready for final, formal acceptance by the customer,&#xD;
    and subsequent close-out. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;{78157368-E2D1-457E-84AF-D8D2C1C20B97}&quot;>Issues List&lt;/a> are reviewed to make sure any residual issues are&#xD;
    understood and have an owner in the support and maintenance organization. If there was a formal acceptance test, the&#xD;
    status of results and corrective actions should be reviewed, to ensure there are no showstoppers going into the formal&#xD;
    Project Acceptance Review. The state of&amp;nbsp;the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_yd3E1NnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>Deployment&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;discipline should be examined to ensure that installation, training&#xD;
    and transition have completed, or that remaining tasks can complete without prejudice to acceptance. The Project&#xD;
    Manager produces a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_status_assessment_A990B5EF.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{F6D674A6-D71A-4D36-A195-4C888C1D0E70}&quot;>Status Assessment&lt;/a> that captures the results of the post-mortem review&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project manager handles the remaining administrative tasks of project termination. These will include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Ensuring that the project is formally accepted: the contract and the Product Acceptance Plan will describe the&#xD;
            requirements. In the end, what is needed, in effect, is signed agreement from the customer that all contracted&#xD;
            deliveries have been made, meet the contracted requirements and are accepted into ownership by the customer;&#xD;
            all contracted tasks (including acceptance test, if any) have been successfully completed; and that the&#xD;
            customer takes all further responsibility (warranty and latent defect claims aside), for the products and any&#xD;
            residual issues and actions associated with them.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Settling the project's finances - making sure all payments have been received and all suppliers and&#xD;
            subcontractors paid. Organizational policy or other regulatory requirement may also require a more formal audit&#xD;
            process at project termination, covering the project's finances, budgeting process, and assets.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Archiving all project documentation and records.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Transferring any remaining (non-deliverable) hardware and environment assets to the owning organization's pool&#xD;
            of assets.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Transfer the project measurements to the corporate historical database.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Reassign remaining project staff: if possible, this should not be done abruptly. Most projects can accommodate&#xD;
            a gradual ramp-down of staff levels, and allow a smoother transition of staff to other projects. The project&#xD;
            manager should ensure that the project knowledge and responsibilities of departing staff have been transferred&#xD;
            to those remaining. Staff performance reviews should also be conducted as staff are transferred.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&lt;br />&#xD;
