    work plans have been consulted and the need for a review identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The work products mentioned in the &quot;Input Work Products&quot; section define a review framework, providing guidance and&#xD;
    directions with regards to what the overall scope of the reviews should be, when they should take place, what is the&#xD;
    level of formalism, and so forth. More detailed guidance could be found in the the Measurement Plan, the Quality&#xD;
    Assurance Plan, the Development Process, and&amp;#160;the&amp;#160;Project Specific Guidelines.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are various approaches to planning review tasks: these approaches vary based on factors such as team size, team&#xD;
    culture, the required formality of the projects process and the current point in the project lifecycle. Some of the&#xD;
    general techniques used include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Inspection&lt;/b>. A formal evaluation technique in which one or more work products are examined in detail.&#xD;
        Inspections are considered to be the most productive review technique, however it requires training, and&#xD;
        preparation to perform them well.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Walkthrough&lt;/b>. An evaluation technique where the author of one or more work products, &quot;walks&quot; one or more&#xD;
        reviewers through the work product. The reviewers ask questions, and make comments regarding technique, style,&#xD;
        possible omissions or errors, deviation from established standards, and so on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Pre-reading &amp;amp; Feedback&lt;/b>. One or more reviewers read through the work product independently and make notes&#xD;
        about their observations. When the reviewers are ready, they can meet and present their comments and questions. The&#xD;
        meeting can be omitted, however, and reviewers can give their comments and questions to the author in written form&#xD;
        instead.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The maximize efficiency and minimize team interruptions, consider planning the reviews in such a way that the required&#xD;
    reviewers can be convened a minimum number of times by having them review as many work products as possible. Obviously&#xD;
    a realistic workload needs to be maintained for each review, so you will need to balance these conflicting needs&#xD;
    accordingly.&#xD;

            &lt;td width=&quot;95%&quot;>&#xD;
                Ensure attendee's are invited and are adequately informed about the review.&#xD;

        &lt;!-- Input_Output Artifact End -->&#xD;
        &lt;!-- Activity Tool Mentors -->&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to provide attendee's with sufficient notice about the review, and to advise them about what will be&#xD;
    expected of them in terms of both preparatory work and their involvement in the review process itself. Make it clear to&#xD;
    each attendee what stakeholding they are being asked to represent and as such the type of review critique and feedback&#xD;
    you are expecting from them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consult each of the specific review tasks and accompanying guidelines in RUP to determine the criteria for inviting&#xD;
    attendees, the recommended preparatory work for an attendee and the expectations that will be placed on them by&#xD;
    agreeing to attend the review. As some general guidance, you should consider the following stakeholders when inviting&#xD;
    attendees to participate in the review meetings:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The subsequent direct consumers of the work product, including testing and documentation staff.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Peers playing the role as the producer of the work product who will act as domain or subject-matter experts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The producer of the work product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The sponsor or budget holder.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The consumer or users of the final product that will be realized from this work product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important to find the right balance between including the desired review participants and keeping the review&#xD;
    manageable and productive. Care should be taken to include only those participants who will contribute to achieving the&#xD;
    objectives of the review. In general, it is usually more productive to hold several focused review sessions with a&#xD;
    smaller number of participants, than to hold one review involving many.&#xD;

&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While each of the specific review tasks and accompanying guidelines in RUP provides specific guidelines and suggestions&#xD;
    about how to conduct each review, the following guidelines are generally helpful when conducting any review:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Always set aside specific time to conduct the review, usually in a recognized and repeatable meeting format, even&#xD;
        if the meeting itself is casual or informal.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To improve productivity, have the meeting participants prepare their own detailed reviews feedback on their own&#xD;
        prior to the meeting.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Check: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                the quality of what has been produced to make sure the work meets an appropriate and acceptable standard of&#xD;
                workmanship.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                the completeness of what has been produced to make sure the work is sufficient for the subsequent work it&#xD;
                will be referenced or consumed in. In many cases, a checklist is provided to help with this task; refer to&#xD;
                the checklists for each work product or its associated tasks.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>Note: you should consider using these checklists in your daily work on each work product: this will&#xD;
        potentially save you time and effort in downstream rework. Note also that these checklists are useful for informal&#xD;
        as well as formal review meetings.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

                    To ensure that any actions identified for attention sub-sequent to the review are assigned and&#xD;

                &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Following each review meeting, the results of the meeting should be documented in some form of &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_review_record_CA816ECE.html&quot; guid=&quot;{4047B5B0-5FB7-4960-8A7E-451719D85DFF}&quot;>Review&#xD;
    Record&lt;/a>. In addition, change request may be formally recorded (and eventually assigned to someone to own and drive&#xD;
    to resolution).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once of the most important yet surprisingly often neglected aspects of reviews is the management to resolution of the&#xD;
    follow-up tasks or actions identified during the review. While you can usually assign many of the identified actions&#xD;
    during the course of the review meeting itself, be prepared to reassign tasks as needed to help balance the workload of&#xD;
    team members.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that even if you can review everything you need to in a single meeting, you probably won't get approval of all&#xD;
    your conclusions the first time. Be prepared to carry out subsequent reviews as necessary to help manage the&#xD;
    undertaking of a large number of follow-up tasks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
