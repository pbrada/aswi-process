&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delivery addresses the notion of integration of work from streams of implementers. As such, delivery is an important&#xD;
    step and a 'quality gate' of reviews and approvals need to be passed before work can be accepted into a higher level&#xD;
    'staging area'.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good project policy is to require developers to rebase their development workspaces to the project's current&#xD;
    recommended baseline before accepting their work into the project's integration workspace. The goal of this policy is&#xD;
    to have developers build and test their work in their development areas against the work included in the most recent&#xD;
    stable baselines before they deliver to the integration workspace. This practice minimizes the amount of merging that&#xD;
    developers must do when they perform deliver operations.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another good project policy is to ensure that all files are checked-in prior to delivery. This avoids the situation of&#xD;
    having orphaned files that are not included in a build and might be needed for subsequent updates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Delivery is an important step that implies that a developer considers his work to be of sufficiently high quality to be&#xD;
    incorporated into the overall product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It should be part of the Project Policy on who is to review given work products, and what level of quality they are to&#xD;
    have achieved before being acceptable for usage by the rest of the project team members. Some guidance on reviews in&#xD;
    provided in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/reviews_9FA4EDE.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;2.981757544469536E-306&quot;>Guideline: Reviews&lt;/a>. Many of the work products in the Rational Unified Process have an&#xD;
    associated '&lt;i>checklist&lt;/i>' that can be used to assess the quality of that work product. For instance, if an work&#xD;
    product is found to be deficient on more than a given number of checkpoints it is submitted for re-work, and thereby&#xD;
    not eligible for 'promotion'.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A common project policy is to require the developer to merge his/her changes with those made by other developers. This&#xD;
    is typically done in a private integration workspace, so that the merged changes may be tested prior to final delivery&#xD;
    to the project integration workspace. The delivery is complete when all merge changes have been checked-in and&#xD;
    delivered.&#xD;
