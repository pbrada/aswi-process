Proof-of-Concept&lt;/i> is to determine whether there exists, or is likely to exist, a solution that satisfies the&#xD;
architecturally-significant requirements.&amp;nbsp;The objective is not to create the final solution but to gain knowledge&#xD;
about the problem (particularly high-risk areas) and possible solutions.</purpose>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The decision about whether or not a System Architecture Proof-of-Concept is required and what form it must take depends&#xD;
    on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How well the domain is understood. If the domain is unfamiliar, the System Architecture Proof-of-Concept might not&#xD;
        only explore possible solutions, but can also help the customer and development organizations understand and&#xD;
        clarify important requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The novelty of the system. If the development organization has constructed many such systems previously, then it&#xD;
        should not be necessary to build a proof-of-concept. It might be possible to base a determination of feasibility on&#xD;
        existing reference architectures and technologies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether or not, even though the domain is familiar and the system is precedented, any of the requirements are&#xD;
        judged to be particularly onerous; for example, extreme reliability or survivability are required, or the system&#xD;
        must function in a particularly hostile physical environment (for example, subjected to high temperature or extreme&#xD;
        radiation levels).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The higher the risk, the more effort needs to be put into this system architectural synthesis activity in Inception&#xD;
    (with the expectation of more realistic results from the models or prototypes produced and assessed), so that all&#xD;
    stakeholders can be convinced that the basis for committing funds and continuing into Elaboration is credible. However,&#xD;
    it has to be recognized that all risks cannot be eliminated in this phase. Do not distort the Inception phase into a&#xD;
    de-facto Elaboration phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
