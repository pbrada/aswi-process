    The System Analysis Model contains the top-level collaboration (system and actors showing the system context), design&#xD;
    subsystems, and Process Model elements (active classes), and any associated artifacts. The System Analysis Model might&#xD;
    be a temporary artifact, as is the case where it evolves into a system design model, or it might continue to live on&#xD;
    through some or all of the project, and perhaps beyond, serving as a conceptual overview of the system.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The System Analysis Model is pitched at a higher level of abstraction than the System Design Model, and it might be&#xD;
    permissible to allow the System Analysis Model to simply evolve into the System Design Model (at which time the System&#xD;
    Analysis Model ceases to exist). There might be good reasons to continue to maintain a separate System Analysis Model:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When the development is of a family of systems, with differing realizations and deployments, for which the System&#xD;
        Analysis Model remains a good overall description.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When the design is elaborate and the System Analysis Model remains a useful teaching instrument.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It needs to be understood that the System Analysis Model, if retained, does need to be kept in synch with the System&#xD;
    Design Model to be useful. This might require more work (to be done properly) than the project is willing to devote to&#xD;
    it. The Project Manager and System Architect need to consider this carefully.&lt;br />&#xD;
