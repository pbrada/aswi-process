  <purpose>&lt;a id=&quot;Top&quot; name=&quot;Top&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a id=&quot;Purpose&quot; name=&quot;Purpose&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the &lt;i>System Development Plan&lt;/i> is to gather all of the information necessary to control the project.&#xD;
    It describes the approach to the development of the system, and is the top-level plan generated and used by the&#xD;
    managers to direct the development effort. It deals with all aspects of management - technical, organizational and&#xD;
    financial. It is a composite artifact, having content of its own, as well as logically or physically containing other&#xD;
    artifacts.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following people use the System Development Plan:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>P&lt;/b>&lt;strong>roject manager&lt;/strong> - to plan the project schedule and resource needs, and to track progress&#xD;
        against the schedule.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Project team members&lt;/strong> - to understand what they need to do, when they need to do it, and what other&#xD;
        activities they are dependent upon.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Other &lt;b>stakeholders -&lt;/b> to understand (and sanction when appropriate) the schedules, resources, planned&#xD;
        deliverables, development and deployment progress, and dependencies (some of which might be expectations of their&#xD;
        participation).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Subcontractors&lt;/b> - to the extent that this top-level plan is flowed-down to them (and thus becomes part of&#xD;
        their contract).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Associate contractors&lt;/b> - to understand and agree the specified organizational interface (points of contact,&#xD;
        method of interaction, and so on) and dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Independent&amp;nbsp; verification and validation agents&lt;/b> - to understand and agree to the specified&#xD;
        organizational interface and dependencies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></purpose>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    In certain situations, a standard is called out in a contract that stipulates the outline and contents of a System&#xD;
    Development Plan. In this case, use that instead of the proposed outline shown in the HTML template, but you need to&#xD;
    form a clear mapping of the information requirements of that standard to the outline in the template provided.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The supplied System Development Plan is comprehensive in its coverage and must be modified to suit the organization's&#xD;
    and project's needs; for example, not all projects use V&amp;amp;V or IV&amp;amp;V (this is a choice based on perceived risk&#xD;
    and complexity) and, in this case, the associated plan can be omitted. The System Development Plan can also vary widely&#xD;
    in &lt;i>physical&lt;/i> form: those enclosed artifacts that might be complex in their own right or which address a separate&#xD;
    discipline, have been delineated as separate artifacts which are referenced from the System Development Plan. This does&#xD;
    not preclude them from being physically bound with the System Development Plan (if this is produced on paper), or&#xD;
    inserted in-line, in an electronic version.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    General&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The System Development Plan is periodically updated (it is not stagnant shelfware), and it is understood and embraced&#xD;
    by managers and engineers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The System Development Plan is the defining document for the project's process. Prepare a single System Development&#xD;
    Plan that:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        complies with organizational standards for content&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        complies with the contract (if any)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        provides traceability to, or waivers from, contract and organization requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        is reviewed and updated (if necessary) with each iteration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        evolves along with the design and requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A standard format promotes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        reuse of processes, methods, experience, and people&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        accountability for organizational expectations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        homogeneous process objectives&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A key discriminator of a good System Development Plan is its conciseness, pragmatism, and focus on meaningful standards&#xD;
    and procedures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Systems Engineering&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is intended that the System Development Plan fulfill the requirements of the &lt;b>Systems Engineering Management&#xD;
    Plan&lt;/b> (SEMP), for example, as called out in IEEE Std 1220-1998 &quot;IEEE Standard for Application and Management of the&#xD;
    Systems Engineering Process.&quot; The documentation of the systems engineering process, as required by the SEMP, is not&#xD;
    repeated in the System Development Plan because it is described in the RUP itself (and so can be referenced), and the&#xD;
    tailoring of that part of the process, to suit the particular needs of the organization and project, is described in&#xD;
    the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_development_case_F4260B3A.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{F071C3D3-7054-457F-8A81-EFA6678CCDE1}&quot;>Artifact: Development Case&lt;/a>, which is referenced from the System&#xD;
    Development Plan. Other requirements of the SEMP, for example, engineering specialty requirements, have been made&#xD;
    explicitly part of the System Development Plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The reader, particularly one who has worked in the mil/aerospace sector, might also be familiar with the notion of a&#xD;
    &lt;b>Test and Evaluation Master Plan&lt;/b> (TEMP). As the US DoD Defense Acquisition Deskbook states (see &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://web2.deskbook.osd.mil&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://web2.deskbook.osd.mil&lt;/a>), &quot;The Test and Evaluation Master&#xD;
    Plan (TEMP) documents the overall structure and objectives of the test and evaluation program. It provides a framework&#xD;
    to generate detailed test and evaluation plans and it documents schedule and resource implications associated with a&#xD;
    test and evaluation program that supports the acquisition strategy.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The TEMP is owned and kept by the customer (and can cover the acquisition of several systems as a &lt;i>program&lt;/i>), and&#xD;
    so is not exactly equivalent to the System Integration, Evaluation and Test Plan, which is a subordinate plan&#xD;
    describing how the development organization intends to perform integration, and so forth, at the System level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
