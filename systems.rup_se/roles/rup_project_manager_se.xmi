    When the system to be developed is a composite of hardware, software, and human workers, the Project Manager might have&#xD;
    an extended set of responsibilities in planning, monitoring, and controlling the project. For example, if parts of the&#xD;
    system development are subcontracted out, the Project Manager will likely be involved in the establishment and&#xD;
    subsequent management of a formal contractual relationship. This typically brings the rigorous definition and control&#xD;
    of interfaces to the fore as an issue, and the planning for integration becomes less flexible. The tracking of progress&#xD;
    in a systems engineering context often requires the Project Manager to set up a formal technical performance&#xD;
    measurement program, because the progress towards the achievement of certain performance or other nonfunctional&#xD;
    characteristics of the system or its components, is as critical as the delivery of the items themselves. The Project&#xD;
    Manager might also have oversight of various engineering specialty activities.&#xD;
