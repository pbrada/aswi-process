    <mainDescription>The overall system lifecycle, is, as any other RUP project, divided into inception, elaboration, construction and&#xD;
transition phases, which have the same meaning as usual. The iterations within these phases also are comprised of&#xD;
invocations of the same disciplines - requirements, analysis and design, implementation and so on. However, at this&#xD;
'outermost' planning level, the some activities and artifacts are added, and some specialized for systems engineering, and&#xD;
there are some additional roles that do not appear in pure software development.&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this level the activities are concerned with the specification of things to be built (subsystems), their behavior,&#xD;
    interfaces and other characteristics, and their subsequent integration and test, rather than the detail of their design&#xD;
    or their implementation (in code, hardware or manual process). So how do the subsystems come into being? They arise&#xD;
    from separate, parallel instance(s) of the RUP lifecycle, fed by and feeding back to the system (outermost)&#xD;
    lifecycle.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We can in fact describe the construction of systems of systems in this way (because in RUP systems are defined in the&#xD;
    context of an enterprise, with the expectation they will potentially interact with other systems) by recursively&#xD;
    invoking cycles like the outermost one until reaching the software (or hardware) construction level, which would use&#xD;
    the default set of RUP activities etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    So at the outmost level, we specify, for example, a subsystem vision artifact, that becomes the vision artifact for the&#xD;
    subordinate RUP lifecycle. While it is not necessary to do so, this gives the project manager the freedom to contract&#xD;
    out the development of subsystems in a formal way.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The outermost cycle takes what is produced by the subordinate cycles and integrates it to validate the system level&#xD;
    architectural decisions, so the elaboration phase at the outermost level still has the goal of producing a stable,&#xD;
    executable architecture - with the ability to respond to issues discovered in the subordinate cycles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;469&quot; alt=&quot;A system with three subsystems, showing lifecycle relationships&quot; src=&quot;resources/se_iterplan.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;678&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Let's look at the way the lifecycles relate to one another: the figure above shows a system development with three&#xD;
    subsystems. The overall system lifecycle is shown at the top and this is the 'outermost' planning level, which both&#xD;
    subsumes (is an abstraction of) the subsystem lifecycles under it, and also contains activities of its own (System&#xD;
    Architectural Analysis, for example). The relationship in time of the cycles is predicated on our expectations of what&#xD;
    is required to begin and to exit the RUP phases.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To begin inception, an initial Vision (perhaps arising from Business Modeling work) is needed to bootstrap the project&#xD;
    into life. At the end of inception, the expectation is that the Vision is mature, the Business Case is acceptable,&#xD;
    critical risks are identified, the System (or Software) Development Plan is established and perhaps a few significant&#xD;
    use cases (and associated descriptions of flow of events) have been developed. Some system architecture&#xD;
    proof-of-concept modeling may also have been done. Therefore, none of the subsystem inception phases can start until&#xD;
    some initial (set of) Vision(s) has been created - i.e. the subsystems (at least some of them) have been identified and&#xD;
    some notion of what they should do has been established - at the earliest, in some modeling or prototyping activity in&#xD;
    system inception.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The structure of the system in terms of subsystems will not be finally determined until some way into system&#xD;
    elaboration, so subsystem inception also does not complete (with a mature subsystem Vision available) until some time&#xD;
    into system elaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work done at the system level in system elaboration generates the subsystem use-case model and subsystem supplementary&#xD;
    requirements (which are then refined in subsystem elaboration) and work done at the subsystem level generates&#xD;
    executable architecture builds, which are fed back to system elaboration. When subsystem elaboration finishes,&#xD;
    subsystem architecture is stable and the subsystem use-case model and subsystem supplementary requirements are&#xD;
    essentially complete. System elaboration does not complete until system architecture is stable, i.e. not until all&#xD;
    subsystem architecture contributions have been integrated and all subsystem elaboration phases are complete. If there&#xD;
    is tolerable attached risk, some subsystems may finish elaboration and proceed into construction before the completion&#xD;
    of system elaboration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At least one iteration in the subsystem transition phase completes before the end of system construction, and then each&#xD;
    subsystem enters an extended transition, which continues until the end of system transition.&#xD;

    Typically this work starts in Inception and continues throughout the lifecycle. Generally this work is most prevalent&#xD;
    in iterations at the very beginning of each phase (or at the end of each preceding phase) to prepare a suitable CM&#xD;
    environment for the forthcoming phase. Note that the requirements for a CM environment often change from phase-to-phase&#xD;
    as the team size expands and contracts: a smaller development team in early phases normally requires a less formal&#xD;
    environment than is required in later phases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is not considered optional, although project culture will mean this work will vary from being a small&#xD;
    consideration to a large endeavor. Note that where an existing CM environment is in place, this work may be more&#xD;
    focused on tailoring that environment to suit the project or lifecycle phase.&#xD;

    To set up an appropriate environment, a person playing the Configuration Manager role needs to have a good

    are established.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A person playing the Integrator role in this work needs to ensure that artifacts delivered from the developer
    workspaces are sufficiently tested such that they can be incorporated into a testable build. The Integrator role needs
    to be familiar with Project CM Policies, Build and Test Practices.

    A Process Engineer is responsible for completing the Development Case. It's unusual that one individual can master all
    disciplines of software development, therefore, it's important that the process engineer consults experts, both within
    and outside of the development organization.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The development of project-specific templates and guidelines can be done by several people. There is no need for
    detailed knowledge of the process to develop these project-specific artifacts.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    There are normally several individuals who act as Tool Specialists. Each individual is then responsible for one tool or
    a group of related tools.

    After developing the components and enclosures of the Software Development Plan, the entire plan is formally reviewed,&#xD;
    for feasibility and acceptability to stakeholders.&amp;nbsp; It becomes the basis for the fine-grained plan for the next&#xD;
    iteration (the Iteration Plan ).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The major effort in creating these artifacts comes early in the inception phase.&amp;nbsp;The Project Manager also collates&#xD;
    all other contributions to the Software Development Plan and assembles them in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The major effort occurs early in the inception phase; thereafter, at the beginning of each iteration (see&#xD;
    Activity:&amp;nbsp; Refine the Development Plan).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Estimation should ideally be based in the organization's own experience, which is then used to calibrate an estimation&#xD;
    model, such as COCOMO. (See [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>BOE81&lt;/a>] for a description&#xD;

    target=&quot;_blank&quot;>http://sunset.usc.edu/research/cocomosuite/index.html&lt;/a> for the latest work.) If the Project Manager&#xD;
    is starting from scratch, using default values for model coefficients, it will be important to use other methods to&#xD;
    validate the estimates. Just as important is to obtain staff and other stakeholder agreement that the estimates are&#xD;
    realistic and achievable. However, the Project Manager has to take into account the experience of staff giving feedback&#xD;
    about estimates. More junior staff may be just guessing numbers and then adding large margins for error; conversely,&#xD;
    their effort estimates may be naively low. The Project Manager must be circumspect when dealing with estimates from&#xD;
    junior staff, and be prepared to counsel them when necessary, and offer the assistance of a more experienced peer. See&#xD;

    This activity will obviously stress the Project Manager's estimation, planning and writing skills. Also, the Project
    Manager must ensure buy-in from affected stakeholders during the construction of these plans, so presentation and
    communication skills will also be important. The Management Reviewer will need to be experienced in the estimation of
    projects in the relevant business or technical domain and should be able to make judgments about the validity of
    assumptions made by the Project Manager. The Management Reviewer should also have enough understanding of the Rational
    Unified Process to judge whether the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity occurs in every iteration of every phase. Issues can come up at any time. The timing of other activities&#xD;
    is tailored to suit the project. For example, the project manager could decide to produce weekly metrics reports, and&#xD;
    report to the PRA monthly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager should put in place mechanisms to automate, as far as possible, the collection and reduction of&#xD;
    information (metrics, for example) about the project. Time should be spent in analyzing trends, not in collection and&#xD;
    calculation. The responsibility for solution of problems that arise on a project obviously ultimately rests with the&#xD;
    Project Manager. However, there is a class of technical problems that should be delegated to the Software Architect,&#xD;
    for example, for solution. The Project Manager's role is then to implement the suggested solution - which may give rise&#xD;
    to a secondary problem, say, lack of resources, which does have to be solved by the Project Manager. This demonstrates&#xD;
    the kind of trust that must exist between the Project Manager and the technical staff - the Project Manager expects the&#xD;
    Software Architect to devise sound technical solutions, and the Software Architect expects the Project Manager to put&#xD;
    in place the infrastructure and resources to implement them, contractual and financial constraints permitting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;p>
    The Project Manager needs a mix of organizational, planning, communication, time management, triage, and analytic
    skills for this part of the discipline. The Management Reviewer will need a strong background in project management,
    will have a deep understanding of the organization's business policies and practices, and be able to make judgments
    about the project's financial performance and performance against contractual obligations.

&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>
    A mix of skills is needed for the activities in this activity: although the Project Manager may rely on a human
    resources function to provide candidate project members, in the end the responsibility for selection is his or hers.
    Interviewing skills are valuable, as is a history of selecting good people. The Project Manager will need to show
    planning, leadership and team building capabilities to initiate the iteration - to allocate the work appropriately, and
    realize the abstract Iteration Plan in effective teams of people.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The evaluation criteria for an iteration should have been set objectively and clearly, so the assessment of an
    iteration requires the Project Manager to be analytic and equally objective.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Management Reviewer for these reviews needs to be very experienced in the domain of the application, and able to
    sift out what is important and what can be ignored or relaxed. While none should be in any doubt about what worked and
    what failed in the iteration, all requirements are not of equal importance, nor are they immutable. Knowledge is gained
    over the course of an iteration and circumstances may change. For example, at the beginning of the iteration, one of
    the evaluation criteria might have said that the response time for a certain function had to be 0.25 seconds or less.
    Let us say that this proved very difficult, and by the time of the Iteration Acceptance Review, the project could only
    demonstrate 0.5 seconds. It is thought that the lower figure can be achieved, but only with the expenditure of
    excessive resources. However, the customer, having seen the function demonstrated in an operational context, finds that
    0.5 seconds is perfectly acceptable.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Failing the iteration on this count alone would not be sensible. Far better for the Project Manager and Management
    Reviewer to agree to relax this requirement, and as compensation, to add capability elsewhere. The Management Reviewer
    (and Project Manager) need the experience and confidence to make these kinds of trades, which do not compromise the
    project vision.

    The Project Manager should work closely with the Software Architect to define the iteration's contents. The Iteration&#xD;

    The Project Manager needs a combination of planning, risk management and estimation skills, and an appreciation for the
    technical content of the iteration, because the iteration's contents will be decided based on considerations of risk,
    the need to demonstrate or deliver certain artifacts and capability, and the natural order imposed by integration. The
    Project Manager will work closely with the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;

    is starting from scratch, using default values for model coefficients, it will be important to use other methods to&#xD;
    validate the estimates. Just as important is to obtain staff and other stakeholder agreement that the estimates are&#xD;
    realistic and achievable. However, the Project Manager has to take into account the experience of staff giving feedback&#xD;
    about estimates. More junior staff may be just guessing numbers and then adding large margins for error; conversely,&#xD;
    their effort estimates may be naively low. The Project Manager must be circumspect when dealing with estimates from&#xD;
    junior staff, and be prepared to counsel them when necessary, and offer the assistance of a more experienced peer. See&#xD;

    This activity will obviously stress the Project Manager's estimation, planning and writing skills. Also, the Project
    Manager must ensure buy-in from affected stakeholders during the construction of these plans, so presentation and
    communication skills will also be important. The Management Reviewer will need to be experienced in the estimation of
    projects in the relevant business or technical domain and should be able to make judgments about the validity of
    assumptions made by the Project Manager. The Management Reviewer should also have enough understanding of the Rational
    Unified Process to judge whether the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    CM policies refer to the ability to identify, safeguard and report on the artifacts that have been approved for use in&#xD;
    a project. Identification is simplified and enabled through the use of proper tools to control project artifacts, and&#xD;
    the systematic labeling of those artifacts over time to identify their relative maturity and their relationships with&#xD;
    each other at given points in time. Systematic identification practices are a key enabler for the safeguarding of&#xD;
    project artifacts through archiving and baselining techniques.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Standard, documented change control processes help to ensure that changes are made within a project in a consistent&#xD;
    manner, and the appropriate stakeholders are informed of the current state of the product, requested changes to it and&#xD;
    the impact of these changes on cost, schedule and so forth.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The CM Plan documents how product related CM activities are to be planned, implemented controlled and organized.&#xD;

    This work is primarily performed in the first iterations in each phase. While most important in the Construction and&#xD;
    Transition phases, this work may be important in the Elaboration and even Inception phase, depending on project&#xD;
    culture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is not considered optional, although it will differ in format, style and level of ceremony to suit the&#xD;
    project context. Note also that the rigidity and formality of the change process tend to change increase over the life&#xD;
    of the project, typically becoming most formal and rigid in the Transition phase.&lt;br />&#xD;

    A person playing the Configuration Manager role needs to be organized by nature, yet flexible enough to plan
    configuration and change control to suit the needs of the project team. The Configuration Manager role supports the
    team by ensuring that the project change policies are reflected within the projects change management tools, enabling
    software developers to easily transition artifacts through state changes in accordance with the defined development and
    approval practices. The Configuration Manager role is required to put measures in place to monitor that the CM Plan is
    being followed as intended, that audit reporting is occurring on a regular basis, and to work with the System
    Administrator role to ensure that backups of CM assets are in safekeeping (e.g. fireproof safe for backup sets on-site,
    weekly backup sets stored off-site).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Change Control Manager is a key arbitration role. In this capacity, the decision for the inclusion of any given
    change in a software build is ultimately made by the Change Control Manager on a project. In practice, only those
    changes of significant potential impact typically warrant monitoring, and any potential impact on the inclusion-or
    exclusion-of changes to the product should be carefully considered with regard to project factors such as the political
    climate, the need to establish trust between developer and customer and so forth.

    Planning the integration is focused on which implementation subsystems should be implemented, and the order in which&#xD;
    the implementation subsystems should be integrated in the current iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Planning the integration process should be done early, at least in rough form, when the architecture is baselined. As&#xD;
    the architecture and design evolve, the integration plan should be examined and updated to ensure that the build plan&#xD;
    does not become obsolete by changes in the architecture or the design.&#xD;
&lt;/p></usageGuidance>

&lt;p>
    Integration is typically carried out by a single person (for a small project on which the build process in simple) or a
    small team (for a large project on which the build process is complex). The integrators need experience in software
    build management, configuration management, and experience in the programming language in which the components to be
    integrated are written. Because integration often involves a high degree of automation, expertise in operating system
    shell or scripting languages and tools like 'make' (on Unix) or 'ant' (for Java) is also essential.

    Deployment planning requires a high degree of customer collaboration and preparation. A successful conclusion to a&#xD;
    software project can be severely impacted by factors &lt;i>outside the scope of software development&lt;/i> such as the&#xD;
    building, hardware infrastructure not being in place, and the staff being ill-prepared for changing to the new system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To ensure successful deployment and transition to the new system and ways of doing business, the Deployment Plan needs&#xD;
    to address not only the deliverable software, but also the development of training material and system support material&#xD;
    to ensure that end users can successfully use the delivered software product.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is performed early in each iteration, generally starting late in the construction phase and continuing&#xD;
    through transition. It can begin as soon as iteration planning is reasonably complete for the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is recommended whenever an executable release will be externally deployed outside the primary development&#xD;
    team, either for the purposes of delivering the software to the end user, or for testing purposes.&#xD;

    A deployment manager needs to be someone who is aware of the operational needs of the end user and capable of pulling
    together all the items that go into making the product. The deployment manager runs the beta test and, in the case of
    &quot;shrink wrap&quot; products, deals with the manufacturers to ensure that adequate quality is achieved in the product.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The deployment manager &quot;gets the product delivered&quot; and, therefore, needs to be well versed in the required
    infrastructure and user needs to ensure that the product is available for the users.

&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;p>
    A mix of skills is needed for the activities in this activity: although the Project Manager may rely on a human
    resources function to provide candidate project members, in the end the responsibility for selection is his or hers.
    Interviewing skills are valuable, as is a history of selecting good people. The Project Manager will need to show
    planning, leadership and team building capabilities to initiate the iteration - to allocate the work appropriately, and
    realize the abstract Iteration Plan in effective teams of people.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The evaluation criteria for an iteration should have been set objectively and clearly, so the assessment of an
    iteration requires the Project Manager to be analytic and equally objective.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Management Reviewer for these reviews needs to be very experienced in the domain of the application, and able to
    sift out what is important and what can be ignored or relaxed. While none should be in any doubt about what worked and
    what failed in the iteration, all requirements are not of equal importance, nor are they immutable. Knowledge is gained
    over the course of an iteration and circumstances may change. For example, at the beginning of the iteration, one of
    the evaluation criteria might have said that the response time for a certain function had to be 0.25 seconds or less.
    Let us say that this proved very difficult, and by the time of the Iteration Acceptance Review, the project could only
    demonstrate 0.5 seconds. It is thought that the lower figure can be achieved, but only with the expenditure of
    excessive resources. However, the customer, having seen the function demonstrated in an operational context, finds that
    0.5 seconds is perfectly acceptable.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Failing the iteration on this count alone would not be sensible. Far better for the Project Manager and Management
    Reviewer to agree to relax this requirement, and as compensation, to add capability elsewhere. The Management Reviewer
    (and Project Manager) need the experience and confidence to make these kinds of trades, which do not compromise the
    project vision.

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity occurs in every iteration of every phase. Issues can come up at any time. The timing of other activities&#xD;
    is tailored to suit the project. For example, the project manager could decide to produce weekly metrics reports, and&#xD;
    report to the PRA monthly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager should put in place mechanisms to automate, as far as possible, the collection and reduction of&#xD;
    information (metrics, for example) about the project. Time should be spent in analyzing trends, not in collection and&#xD;
    calculation. The responsibility for solution of problems that arise on a project obviously ultimately rests with the&#xD;
    Project Manager. However, there is a class of technical problems that should be delegated to the Software Architect,&#xD;
    for example, for solution. The Project Manager's role is then to implement the suggested solution - which may give rise&#xD;
    to a secondary problem, say, lack of resources, which does have to be solved by the Project Manager. This demonstrates&#xD;
    the kind of trust that must exist between the Project Manager and the technical staff - the Project Manager expects the&#xD;
    Software Architect to devise sound technical solutions, and the Software Architect expects the Project Manager to put&#xD;
    in place the infrastructure and resources to implement them, contractual and financial constraints permitting.&#xD;

    The Project Manager needs a mix of organizational, planning, communication, time management, triage, and analytic

    The core development team should conduct a few rounds of internal reviews: walk-throughs to clean up unnecessary&#xD;
    inconsistencies before their work is more formally inspected and reviewed by the extended team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should divide the material up so that the team does not review everything at once. A review meeting shouldn't take&#xD;
    more than a day. For example, you might conduct separate reviews of the user interface and the behavioral scenarios, or&#xD;
    you might review all of the requirements artifacts related to a given subsystem.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another important consideration is the tracking of requirement history. By capturing the nature and rationale of&#xD;
    requirements changes, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/roles/rup_reviewer_19930772.html&quot;&#xD;

    properly.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity should be performed in whenever requirements are refined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Regular reviews, along with updates to the requirement attributes and dependencies, should be done whenever the&#xD;
    requirements are updated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is recommended that you arrange one review of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    in detail, and is a very important milestone so that resources are not spent on developing incorrect use cases. Then,&#xD;
    at the end of the Elaboration phase, you should arrange a detailed review of the use-case model. Remember that at the&#xD;
    end of the Elaboration phase, you should have a use-case model, and possibly a domain model representing the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_glossary_A5D79A0C.html&quot;&#xD;

    the use-case model per iteration in the Construction and Transition phases when the use-case model is refined. The&#xD;
    review should concentrate on the part of the use case model being developed for the iteration.&#xD;

    While this work starts in Inception and continues throughout the lifecycle, it tends to gain importance as the&#xD;
    lifecycle progresses. It is often much more formally managed in Transition than it starts out being managed in&#xD;
    Inception.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is not considered optional, although project culture will mean this work will vary from being a small&#xD;
    informal consideration to a larger more formal endeavor. Note that some CM environments may enable the Change (or&#xD;

    The Change (or Configuration) Control Board (CCB) oversees the change process, and consists of representatives playing
    various roles in RUP. Typically this includes managers, stakeholders (customers, end-users), developers, and testers.
    In a small project, a single person, such as the project manager or software architect, may be the only representative
    on the CCB. In the Rational Unified Process, this primary CCB role is the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;

    It should be noted that activities being performed in this capability pattern are not performed in sequence.&amp;nbsp; In&#xD;

    non-use-case-specific requirements (e.g., system-wide requirements), we may encounter requirements that only apply to a&#xD;
    particular use case, in which case the requirement is associated with the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although much of the work is done individually, frequent reviews (i.e. walk-throughs) should be performed to calibrate&#xD;

    The objective is to gain an understanding of the constraints and limitations of each technique as it will be applied in&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        find an appropriate implementation solution for each technique&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This helps to mitigate the risk of discovering too late in the project lifecycle that the test approach is&#xD;
    unworkable.&lt;br />&#xD;
     For each iteration, this work is focused mainly on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Early verification that the intended test strategy will work and produces results of value&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity starts early in each iteration, as soon as sufficient agreement is reached on the mission for the&#xD;
    iteration, and continues as needed throughout the iteration. More frequently addressed in the earlier phases of&#xD;
    Inception, Elaboration and early Construction, typically tapering off in late Construction and Transition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity is considered optional when the test approach is well known, and its applicability in the current context&#xD;
    is well established.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is somewhat independent of the test cycles, often involving the verification of techniques that will not be&#xD;
    used until subsequent Iterations. This work normally begins after the evaluation mission has been defined for the&#xD;
    current Iteration, although it can begin earlier. In some cases, finding the best implementation approach to a&#xD;
    technique may take multiple Iterations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The test implementation and execution activities that form a part of this work are performed for the purpose of&#xD;
    obtaining demonstrable proof that the techniques being verified can actually work. As such, you should limit your&#xD;
    selection of tests to a small, representative subset; typically focusing on areas with substantial quality risk. You&#xD;
    should try to include a selection of tests that you expect to fail to confirm that the technique will successfully&#xD;
    detect these failures.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    While failures with the target test items will be identified and these incidents logged accordingly, this focus of this&#xD;
    work is not directly on attempting to identify failures in the target test items as it's main objective. Again, the&#xD;
    objective is to verify that the approach is appropriate (it produces results that complement the Iteration objectives),&#xD;
    is achievable (it can be implemented with given resource constraints), and that it will work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For this work to produce timely results, it is often necessary to make use of incomplete, &quot;unofficial&quot; Builds, or to&#xD;
    perform this work outside of a recognized Test Environment Configuration. Although these are appropriate compromises,&#xD;
    be aware of the constraints, assumptions and risks involved in verifying your approach in under these conditions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As the lifecycle progresses through its Phases, the focus of the test effort typically changes. Potentially this&#xD;
    requires new or additional approaches, often requiring the introduction of new types of tests or new techniques to&#xD;
    support the test effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In situations where the combination of domain, the test environment and other critical aspects of the strategy are&#xD;
    unprecedented, you should allow more time and effort to complete this work. In some cases-especially where automation&#xD;
    is a requirement-it may be more economic to obtain the use of resources with specialized skills that have proven&#xD;
    experience in the unprecedented aspects of the strategy for a limited period of time (such as on contract) to define&#xD;
    and verify the key technical needs of the test strategy.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    It is typical for this work to require more resource in iterations from the late Inception to early Construction
    phases, often requiring minimal resource late in the Construction and in the Transition phases. However, be aware that
    as the project progresses, new objectives or deliverables may be identified that require new test strategies to be
    defined and verified.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    As a heuristic for relative resource allocation by phase, typical percentages of test resource use for
    this&amp;nbsp;activity are: Inception - 30%, Elaboration - 20%, Construction - 10% and Transition - 05%.

    If several implementers work (as a team) on the same Implementation Subsystem, the changes from the individual&#xD;
    implementers need to be integrated to create a new consistent version of the Implementation Subsystem. The integration&#xD;
    results in series of builds in a subsystem integration workspace. Each build is then integration tested by a tester or&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Integration work is typically automated to a large degree, with manual effort required when the build breaks. A&#xD;

    Integration is typically carried out by a single person (for a small project on which the build process in simple) or a
    small team (for a large project on which the build process is complex). The integrators need experience in software
    build management, configuration management, and experience in the programming language in which the components to be
    integrated are written. Because integration often involves a high degree of automation, expertise in operating system
    shell or scripting languages and tools like 'make' (on Unix) or 'ant' (for Java) is also essential.

    The integrator integrates the system, in accordance with the integration build plan, by adding the delivered&#xD;
    implementation subsystems into the system integration workspace and creating builds. Each build is then integration&#xD;
    tested by a tester. After the last increment, the build can be completely system tested by a tester.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Integration work is typically automated to a large degree, with manual effort required when the build breaks. A&#xD;
    frequent strategy is to perform automated nightly builds and some automated testing (usually at the unit level),&#xD;
    allowing for frequent feedback from the build process.&#xD;
&lt;/p></usageGuidance>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;a id=&quot;HowToStaff&quot; name=&quot;HowToStaff&quot;>&lt;/a> 
&lt;p>
    Integration is typically carried out by a single person (for a small project on which the build process in simple) or a
    small team (for a large project on which the build process is complex). The integrators need experience in software
    build management, configuration management, and experience in the programming language in which the components to be
    integrated are written. Because integration often involves a high degree of automation, expertise in operating system
    shell or scripting languages and tools like 'make' (on Unix) or 'ant' (for Java) is also essential.

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically performed once per test cycle, this work involves performing the core tactical work of the test and&#xD;
    evaluation effort: namely the implementation, execution and evaluation of specific tests and the corresponding&#xD;
    reporting of incidents that are encountered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each test cycle, this work is focused mainly on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Providing ongoing evaluation and assessment of the Target Test Items&#xD;

        Recording the appropriate information necessary to diagnose and resolve any identified Issues&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Achieving suitable breadth and depth in the test and evaluation work&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Starting typically in Elaboration, this work is generally performed multiple times during an iteration, once per test&#xD;
    cycle based on the availability of a series of Builds that warrant independent testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As noted, this work is typically performed multiple times during an iteration; the actual number of times often&#xD;
    equating to once per Build. Note however that it's typical not to test every Build. Note also that the Build schedule&#xD;
    will often result in this work increasing in frequency during the course of the iteration. The need for additional&#xD;
    cycles is governed by assessing when appropriate breadth and depth of testing is achieved within a test cycle, which is&#xD;
    the focus of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/capabilitypatterns/achieve_acceptable_mission_18DE9944.html&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For iterations prior to and including those early in the Construction phase, additional effort is usually required to&#xD;
    address tactical problems encountered for the first time during test implementation and execution. These issues often&#xD;
    detract from the number of actual tests successfully implemented and executed and limit either the breadth or depth of&#xD;
    the testing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The sophistication and availability of test automation tools and the necessary prerequisite skills to use them&#xD;
    effectively will have an impact on the resourcing of this work. It may be appropriate to strategically deploy&#xD;
    specialized contract resource for some part of this work to improve the likelihood of success. It may also be more&#xD;
    economical to lease the automation tools and contract appropriately skilled people to use the tools, especially to help&#xD;
    mitigate the risks in getting started. You need to balance the benefits of this approach with the necessity to develop&#xD;
    in-house skills to maintain automation assets into the future.&#xD;
&lt;/p></usageGuidance>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;a id=&quot;HowToStaff&quot; name=&quot;HowToStaff&quot;>&lt;/a> 
&lt;p>
    The work is primarily centered around the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;

    guid=&quot;{8728060F-9DAD-42AD-B0B6-668C9AEA531D}&quot;>Test Analyst&lt;/a> roles. The most important skills required for this work
    include investigative and analytical skills, tenacity, thoroughness, good technical knowledge and good verbal and
    written communication skills (documentation of incidents, change requests and so on).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    As a heuristic for relative resource allocation by phase, typical percentages of test resource use for
    this&amp;nbsp;activity are: Inception - 05%, Elaboration - 25%, Construction - 40% and Transition - 35%.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Where the requirement for test automation is particularly important, it may be useful to assign the creation and
    maintenance of automation assets to a separate sub-team, allowing them to specialize on automation concerns. This
    allows the other team members to focus on the improvement of non-automation test assets.

    The Project Manager needs a combination of planning, risk management and estimation skills, and an appreciation for the
    technical content of the iteration, because the iteration's contents will be decided based on considerations of risk,
    the need to demonstrate or deliver certain artifacts and capability, and the natural order imposed by integration. The
    Project Manager will work closely with the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first step in any problem analysis is to make sure that all parties involved agree on what the problem is that&#xD;
    needs to be solved—or opportunity that will be realized—by the system.&amp;nbsp; In order to help avoid misunderstandings,&#xD;
    it is important to agree on common terminology which will be used throughout the project. Starting early in the&#xD;
    lifecycle, you should define your project terms in a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_glossary_A5D79A0C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{3BF8CC04-9101-47A4-9473-C8205EA588B6}&quot;>Glossary&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;which will be maintained throughout the life of the&#xD;
    project (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/tasks/capture_common_vocabulary_9BA76DA7.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{962AC6BA-4ACA-4D7D-B56F-24558A026854}&quot;>Capture a Common Vocabulary&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to fully understand the problem(s) that need to be addressed, it is very important to know who the&#xD;
    stakeholders are in the conceptual vision for the project. These key stakeholders should be involved in gathering the&#xD;
    set of features to be considered, which might be gathered in a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/requirements_workshop_EEF2B469.html&quot; guid=&quot;4.234130639739827E-305&quot;>Requirements&#xD;
    Workshop&lt;/a>. The features can then be assigned attributes such as rationale, relative value or priority, source of&#xD;
    request and so on, so that dependencies and work plans can begin to be managed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The primary artifact in which you capture the information gained from your problem analysis is the &lt;a&#xD;

    be used in defining the system and managing the scope of the system (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

    This information results in a refinement of the vision, as well as a better understanding of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    you may start discussing the functional requirements of the system in terms of its &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

    Actors and Use Cases&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp; Those requirements which do not fit appropriately within the use cases should be&#xD;
    documented in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_supplementary_specification_F5ACAA22.html&quot;&#xD;

    Supplementary Specifications&lt;/a>).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you define new requirements, it is important to document any dependencies (e.g., &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/traceability_8F6B898D.html&quot; guid=&quot;1.4005695544042474E-306&quot;>Traceability&lt;/a>)&#xD;
    between these requirements (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/tasks/manage_dependencies_4F6CEFAA.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{7F42C4D6-584F-4B19-9B0B-FDE86BD85FBB}&quot;>Manage Dependencies&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    It should be noted that activities being performed in this capability pattern are not performed in sequence.&amp;nbsp; In&#xD;
    fact, it is more-often the case that these activities are performed concurrently. For example, while identifying actors&#xD;
    and use cases (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/tasks/find_actors_and_use_cases_1ACB35F0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{3CD5FA7E-160C-4A39-9DEB-C6D162D8AECD}&quot;>Find Actors and Use Cases&lt;/a>), we may encounter requirements that do not&#xD;
    naturally align with a particular use case, in which case the requirement may be defined in the Supplementary&#xD;
    Specifications (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/tasks/develop_supplementary_specification_52FC4CAE.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_I5vM8DJwEdqLGaxX1Cc4eA&quot;>Develop Supplementary Specifications&lt;/a>). Conversely, while identifying&#xD;
    non-use-case-specific requirements (e.g., system-wide requirements), we may encounter requirements that only apply to a&#xD;
    particular use case, in which case the requirement is associated with the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p></keyConsiderations>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This activity is primarily performed in iterations during the Inception and Elaboration phases, however it may be&#xD;
    revisited as needed when &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

    The project members involved in understanding stakeholder needs should be efficient facilitators and have experience in
    eliciting information. Of course, familiarity with the targeted technology is desirable, but it is not essential.

    In this depiction of a system development Elaboration iteration, the Analysis and Design workflow differs from the&#xD;
    software development plan in the&amp;nbsp;activities that are invoked - Define Candidate System Architecture, Analyze&#xD;
    System Behavior and Refine System Architecture in which the system architecture (structure, process and locality) is&#xD;
    refined, along with the Subsystem Vision, Subsystem Use-Case Model and Subsystem Supplementary Requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Subsystem development is shown as a summary&amp;nbsp;activity which runs in parallel with the system-level iteration: this&#xD;
    should expand into a set of subactivities which replicate those under Software Development if the subproject is&#xD;
    substantially software, or a set similar to those in the top-level Systems Engineering plan, if the the subsystem is&#xD;
    itself a composite of hardware, software, and people.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that Implementation has been reduced to system integration, given that all construction takes place at the&#xD;
    subsystem level. Details of Implementation, Test and Deployment, as they are affected for system development, are out&#xD;
    of scope for this release of RUP for Systems Engineering.&#xD;

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this depiction of a system development Inception iteration, the business modeling workflow as it impacts this system&#xD;
    is assumed to have occurred essentially before development begins, as part of a separately planned project at the&#xD;
    enterprise level, which might identify several systems (including this one) for development.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Analysis and Design workflow differs from the software development plan in the activities that are invoked -&#xD;
    Synthesize System Architecture and&amp;nbsp;Define Subsystem Operations&amp;nbsp;- which are performed with the intention of&#xD;
    establishing the feasibility of the development, and generating enough information (an embryonic Subsystem Vision and&#xD;
    perhaps some preliminary subsystem Use-Cases and preliminary Subsystem Supplementary Requirements) to begin subsystem&#xD;
    development.&#xD;
