    <sectionDescription>When this&amp;nbsp;task is performed in the context of &lt;i>systems engineering&lt;/i> (with the expectation that the system under&#xD;
scrutiny will decompose into further subsystems), the expectation is that business modeling (or some equivalent) will have&#xD;
identified and characterized the boundary of the system to be developed (as a &lt;i>Business System&lt;/i> in the case of&#xD;
business modeling), and that the actors in the enterprise with which the system must interact to deliver business value,&#xD;
have been identified. In this context then, this&amp;nbsp;task is concerned mainly with the derivation of system use cases. If&#xD;
business modeling is not performed, some equivalent mission modeling is needed to discover actors and use cases - in this&#xD;
case the following steps may have value in this discovery.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>If analysis has proceeded at the enterprise level (using business modeling or some equivalent) then&amp;nbsp;business use&#xD;
cases&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;business analysis model&amp;nbsp;(with business use-case realizations and operations) will be available.&#xD;
The business use-case realizations will have delineated the role the system will play in the enterprise and defined the&#xD;
interactions between the system and other entities in the enterprise. These other entities are the actors. The use cases&#xD;
for the system can be determined from a process of aggregation of the system's interactions with other entities, by looking&#xD;
for similarities in the messages exchanged. This process can proceed from the business use-case realizations, or from the&#xD;
'white-box' description of the business use-case. See the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/use_case_flowdown_6BF482DB.html&quot; guid=&quot;_6SxgEOM9EdmaZcY4PeqVxA&quot;>Concept: Use-Case&#xD;
Flowdown&lt;/a>, for more information. The use cases so discovered may be captured in diagrams (associated with the &lt;a&#xD;
class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_usecase_model_EF15E534.html&quot;&#xD;
guid=&quot;{9C66F2EC-EDEB-4369-9AFB-04B9E7CBCB8E}&quot;>Artifact: Use-Case Model&lt;/a>). Any performance or other constraints (derived&#xD;
from the supplementary business specification or other source) that may be associated with the system use-cases should be&#xD;
captured in the 'special requirements' property of the use case. &#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Outline the Flow of Events&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This initial description of the interactions between the system's actors and the system is pure 'black box', that is,&#xD;
    it does not reveal anything about the internal structure of the system. It should be constructed as a sequence of steps&#xD;
    ('black box steps' - see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/use_case_CC89870D.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;4.1983217662266927E-305&quot;>Guideline: Use Case&lt;/a>), each of which represents a fine-grain interaction with the&#xD;
    system. These black box steps will be used to guide the identification of 'services' to be supported by the system (see&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../systems.rup_se/tasks/se_define_system_context_1233657D.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{C66A11BC-B869-4702-AE8D-C8347BD0AA96}&quot;>Task: Define the System Context&lt;/a>). Each black box step may be&#xD;
    annotated with performance or other resource constraints which are driven by external needs (for example in order to&#xD;
    achieve some overall response time). The allocation of such budgets has to be done carefully, recognizing the&#xD;
    complexity of each step, and will be refined as the use-case description is refined and realized. It may be the case&#xD;
    that the driving requirement itself has to be relaxed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Collect Additional Requirements&#xD;
&lt;/h5>For many systems, there may be: &#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        physical requirements such as constraints on size, weight or power consumption&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        environmental requirements, such as heat tolerance, vibration resistance or contaminant resistance&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        additional product assurance requirements, such as safety, security, survivability&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>In this context we will delineate the input/output entities that flow between actor and system. In the general systems&#xD;
case, these entities can include data, mass flow, energy or discrete physical objects. Later, outside this task, we will&#xD;
also describe the interface protocols associated with their exchange. This is done in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

Cases), you should include a broad description of what is exchanged in the actor-system use-case association (with each&#xD;
association). Any interface constraints (because the system must communicate with an existing system or external hardware)&#xD;
should be captured in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
