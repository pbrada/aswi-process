&lt;p>&#xD;
    The System Architect is prompted to perform this&amp;nbsp;task by any significant change in the system's environment&#xD;
    (reflected in the &lt;i>system context,&lt;/i> the top-level collaboration between the system and its actors), refactoring&#xD;
    during &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../systems.rup_se/tasks/se_operation_design_FE6558AC.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_Gb4P8OQ7Edm1mN374l9mbg&quot;>Task: System Operation Design&lt;/a>, or the System Architect's own refinements made in &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../systems.rup_se/tasks/refine_system_deployment_model_AAD44C73.html&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;{43DD441B-6B4C-4998-B5D9-2A15894C5D56}&quot;>Task: Refine System Structure&lt;/a>. The System Architect examines these&#xD;
    changes to determine what effect, if any, they have on the system-level processes. For example, if additional&#xD;
    interfaces to the system's environment are to be supported, perhaps additional active (boundary) classes are needed.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The assumption is that subsystems, by default, can operate autonomously and concurrently with other subsystems (that&#xD;
    is, they encapsulate one or more independent loci of control). Thus, it is a design decision whether additional&#xD;
    processes (active classes) that are not encapsulated in subsystems are defined at this level. For example, whether&#xD;
    active (boundary) classes are needed to drive and respond to external interfaces, or whether active control classes are&#xD;
    needed to coordinate the actions of subsystems, or whether, at this level only subsystems appear. A rule of thumb is&#xD;
    that there be at least one thread of control within the system, for each interface offered by a system (or subsystem),&#xD;
    but these threads of control might themselves be encapsulated (within subsystems). Processes (and associated&#xD;
    &lt;i>threads&lt;/i>) are rooted in active classes; and instances of these (as active objects), not encapsulated in&#xD;
    subsystems, can appear in interaction diagrams with subsystem instances, as shown below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;!--Figure lacks a caption. -->&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that the active classes Operator Keyboard, Operator Display and Printer, Laser Scanner and Magnetic Stripe Reader&#xD;
    could be encapsulated within the subsystem Point-of-Sale Control, exposing these at the system level could be driven,&#xD;
    for example, by their perceived importance, deployment issues, or the need to use them in some other application (which&#xD;
    would indicate that the active classes are not simply &quot;dumb&quot; device drivers).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Just as interesting as the existence of an active object and whether particular subsystems are, for some interactions&#xD;
    at least, passive, is the sequence or path of a process (or thread). An invoked operation can, in turn, invoke others&#xD;
    (in other subsystems) using the same process, and possible delays (waiting for resources, for example) might be&#xD;
    critically important to the System Architect, if processes have deadlines to meet. Repartitioning the subsystems might&#xD;
    lead the System Architect to reconsider the process structure.&#xD;

    Decisions made in this&amp;nbsp;task are captured in the System Analysis Model (if this is separately maintained) and&#xD;
    System Design Model; those aspects which the System Architect considers to be significant are also recorded in the &lt;a&#xD;

    The effectiveness of proposed solutions need to be reviewed with the stakeholders and the development team to ensure&#xD;
    that all concurrent processing requirements and constraints (meeting deadlines, responsiveness and throughput, for&#xD;
    example) are satisfied. Techniques such as simulation and prototyping can be used to provide more objective&#xD;
    demonstrations of the adequacy of the design(s).&#xD;
