    Staffing the Inception and Elaboration Phases&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the systems engineering context, the team has similar constituents, with a System Architect as well as a Software&#xD;
    Architect and perhaps a few more System Designers (depending on scope) because there is typically more analysis and&#xD;
    trade study work to be done (in systems development at this level).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The emphases are similar to software engineering, but the system architecture team is not focused solely on software&#xD;
    and has a wider range of skills, in the systems engineering discipline itself, as well as hardware engineering and&#xD;
    other engineering specialties.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Staffing the Construction Phase&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;systemsengineering&quot;>&#xD;
    At the systems level, there is a focus on integration during construction, given that, at least in a large system&#xD;
    development, much of the actual construction might be subcontracted. So there is an intense interest in interfaces&#xD;
    during construction, in keeping these clearly defined and stable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Staffing testing activities&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to the issues canvassed above, there might be other factors which affect what the system test team does and&#xD;
    its composition. There might be a considerable logistics element to test at the systems level: specialized test rigs&#xD;
    might be needed for test performance and test analysis; testing might take place away from the development center so&#xD;
    transport and set-up becomes an issue. The verification of specialty engineering requirements might need engineers with&#xD;
    corresponding skills to participate, and so on.&#xD;
