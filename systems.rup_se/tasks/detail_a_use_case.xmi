    <sectionDescription>From a systems engineering perspective, it is better that the use-case description be kept 'black box' at this stage, and&#xD;
constructed around the view of actor action, system input, black-box step (what the system does) and system output (which&#xD;
might flow to other actors). &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/use_case_CC89870D.html&quot;&#xD;
guid=&quot;4.1983217662266927E-305&quot;>Guideline: Use Case&lt;/a> for more information. Description of what the system &lt;i>might&lt;/i> do&#xD;
internally (to produce the response) might be necessary, but in no way constrains the system design. When such descriptions&#xD;
are written, they typically use terminology well-understood in the domain. They might refer to the &lt;i>state&lt;/i> of the&#xD;
system (for example, when the response is conditional upon that state) and &lt;i>stores&lt;/i> that the system notionally&#xD;
contains. This, however, reveals nothing about how the system maintains such state or stores internally, only requiring&#xD;
that it behaves (in its history of interactions) as if it did. &#xD;
&lt;!--Author: The last sentence in this paragraph does not make sense, and it is not grammatically correct. To what does the pronoun &quot;This&quot; refer? Also, the words &quot;only requiring that it behaves (in its history of interactions) as if it did&quot; consitute a dangling participle. As a result, the reader doesn't know exactly what these words are modifying. --></sectionDescription>

    This step has particular significance in systems engineering: because you intend to flow down non-functional&#xD;
    requirements to subsystems, the tracking and allocation of such requirements must be done with some rigor. In &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/tasks/find_actors_and_use_cases_1ACB35F0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{3CD5FA7E-160C-4A39-9DEB-C6D162D8AECD}&quot;>Task: Find Actors and Use Cases&lt;/a>, you did a preliminary allocation to&#xD;
    use cases and to steps within a use case. In this activity, you review the Supplementary Specifications and the&#xD;
    use-case description to refine this allocation, possibly updating the use-case Special Requirements and the black-box&#xD;
    step budgeted requirements.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p class=&quot;systemsengineering&quot;>&#xD;
    This step has special significance in systems engineering, because it is likely that the system will interact with&#xD;
    several external systems or pieces of hardware. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Find Actors and Use Cases&lt;/a> produced a broad description of what is exchanged in the actor-system use-case&#xD;
    association (with each association). Now you elaborate that description by selecting a protocol for it. These interface&#xD;
    descriptions are further elaborated in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
