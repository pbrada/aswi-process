    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This process delivers the combined tasks, techniques and guidance from RUP/SOA and IBM Global Business Services SOMA&#xD;
    method. The delivery process is intended to focus the reader only on those aspects core to a SOA project, and while&#xD;
    there may be additional techniques in the rest of RUP which are useful, the delivery process brings to the fore the&#xD;
    critical elements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The four phases described in this delivery process are intended to be iterative in themselves as well as an assumption&#xD;
    that multiple iterations of the overall process take place. For example, given a complete set of artifacts from the&#xD;
    Business Transformation Analysis phase it may be that the multiple identification and specification phases are executed&#xD;
    to divide up the business models and allow each identification iteration to deal with a subset (and the same for the&#xD;
    specification of the identified services).&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this reference process is to provide the core activities and tasks for completing a SOA project. While&#xD;
    it reuses aspects from core RUP and RUP Business Modeling, this&amp;nbsp;reference process brings together only those&#xD;
    aspects specific to SOA development. The intent is to apply this reference process in an iterative manner,&amp;nbsp;see the&#xD;
    RUP Classic delivery process for an example of such an application.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
    <scope>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The result of a Business Transformation Analysis is often a broad model of the entire business while focusing deeply on&#xD;
    critical competencies and business components. The RUP/SOMA process may be focused on one of the following scopes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Broad transformation of the business to an SOA, re-engineering all core systems into core and composite services in&#xD;
        support of agile business processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Transformation of a key business component into a set of IT services.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Addition of new services to implement new capabilities in support of an existing business process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Additionally, the techniques here may also be applied to Infrastructure Services, those that are entirely defined and&#xD;
    implemented in support of IT requirements, in which case the need will not be traced back to the work products from&#xD;
    Business Transformation Analysis.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Goal-Service Model can be thought of as going through two elaborations.&amp;nbsp; The first elaboration captures the&#xD;
    initial structure of goals, sub-goals, KPIs and metrics for the project, and maps goals and sub-goals to candidate&#xD;
    services where possible.&amp;nbsp; At the end of this elaboration there may be goals or sub-goals that do not yet map to a&#xD;
    service.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The second elaboration takes place when making service exposure decisions, during which candidate services are&#xD;
    evaluated for business alignment.&amp;nbsp; Any service that is going to be chosen for exposure must map to at least one&#xD;
    goal or sub-goal in the Goal-Service Model.&amp;nbsp; This can result in an update to the Goal-Service Model to document&#xD;
    the service mapping, and potentially to add a new goal or sub-goal (subject to careful evaluation for fit with business&#xD;
    objectives).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Goal-Service Modeling, similar to other SOMA activities, is typically carried out using an approach that incrementally&#xD;
    builds a Goal-Service Model through several iterations.&amp;nbsp; One area of the Goal-Service Model may be found to be&#xD;
    complete to the point described for the first elaboration, while another portion may already complete to the point&#xD;
    described for the second elaboration.&amp;nbsp; Eventually additional iterations of Goal-Service Modeling and Service&#xD;
    Exposure Decisions will result in a Goal-Service Model that has been completed to the second level of elaboration for&#xD;
    all areas of the model that are necessary to complete the current project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The information needed to create an instance of the Goal-Service Model work product can be gathered through interviews&#xD;
    and facilitated work sessions.&amp;nbsp; To provide structure for the interviews or work sessions, an instance of the&#xD;
    Goal-Service Model template can be filled out during the sessions, providing all participants with a visible and&#xD;
    evolving framework of goals and sub-goals.&#xD;
