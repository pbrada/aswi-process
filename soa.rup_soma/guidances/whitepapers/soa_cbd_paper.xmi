    Abstract
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    This paper provides the context for a deeper understanding of services and SOAs for enterprise-scale software
    solutions. In particular, it explores services in relationship to the more established concept of software components
    and it describes how current component-based development practices provide a tried and tested foundation for the
    implementation of a SOA. Interface-based design is highlighted as the key to both service and component design and it
    is argued that the interfaces exposed by both have certain distinguishing constraints and criteria. The Unified
    Modeling Language (UML) is used as a tool to describe logical and implementation designs as well as specific patterns
    for component and service design.
