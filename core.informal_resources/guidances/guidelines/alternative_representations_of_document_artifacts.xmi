    Even though many of the RUP work products are named &quot;plan&quot; or &quot;document&quot;, the intent of a RUP work product is to&#xD;
    describe the creation of and communication of information, not to impose a particular representation. Templates&#xD;
    supplied with RUP are provided for those who wish to use a document and to provide an outline of the information that&#xD;
    belongs to the work product, however, there are many alternative means of capturing and communicating information. Some&#xD;
    of these are listed below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Direct Communication / No Documentation&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is often more important to perform an activity than to document it. It is frequently more important to communicate&#xD;
    information than to document it for later use.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, you may choose to hold regular meetings in which project status is communicated to key stakeholders, and&#xD;
    not generate a separate Work Product: Status Assessment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Email&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Direct communication is not always an option. For example, you may have key stakeholders that cannot attend status&#xD;
    meetings, but still need to be kept in the loop. Email is often a good means of capturing and communicating information&#xD;
    that is not updated and maintained, such as Work Product: Status Assessment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Whiteboards&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For small co-located teams, or when information is being modified rapidly, a white-board is often a good means of&#xD;
    capturing and communicating information, rather than creating a formal document.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Collaborative Groupware&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A virtual white-board, such as that provided by a WikiWeb (see &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;http://www.wikiweb.com/&quot;>http://www.wikiweb.com&lt;/a>) can be effective means of sharing information for&#xD;
    distributed teams.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Spreadsheets&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For information that needs sorting or numerical computation, a spreadsheet is often ideal. Work Product: Risk List is&#xD;
    an example.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Tool Repositories / Reports&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If information is captured in a commonly available tool repository, then stakeholders may simply go to the tool to view&#xD;
    the information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, Work Product: Work Order can be managed as CRs in Rational ClearQuest, requirements can be managed in&#xD;
    Rational RequisitePro. Reports can be provided to stakeholders who don't wish to access the tool directly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Documents&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Documents are easily distributed through email, fax, mail, or placement on a common network drive. Documents are easily&#xD;
    versioned, so that one can track changes over time, or use as an asset on a future project. The RUP provides document&#xD;
    examples and templates that guide the author in capturing the appropriate information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Combination Documents&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many work products are sufficiently related that you may wish to combine them into a single document. Some common&#xD;
    examples include the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deployment Plan merged into the Project Plan&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Status Assessments merged into the Iteration Assessment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Supplementary Specification merged into the Vision&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
