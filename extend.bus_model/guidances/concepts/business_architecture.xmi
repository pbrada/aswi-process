&lt;p>&#xD;
    We define business architecture as an organized set of elements with clear relationships to one another, which together&#xD;
    form a whole defined by its functionality. The elements represent the organizational and behavioral structure of a&#xD;
    business system and show abstractions of the key processes and structures of the business [&lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot;&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Context of Business Architecture&quot; name=&quot;Context of Business Architecture&quot;>Context of Business Architecture&lt;img&#xD;
    height=&quot;20&quot; alt=&quot;To top of page&quot; src=&quot;../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Different people have different backgrounds and perspectives. When attempting to achieve a common understanding on&#xD;
    something as complex as the organization-including its processes, structure, and strategy-we need a way to describe&#xD;
    architecture and architecturally significant issues in a way that will be understood by each impacted group. This is&#xD;
    done by describing three different-yet-related architectures as shown and described later in this document.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;334&quot; alt=&quot;Image described by content&quot; src=&quot;resources/co_barc1.gif&quot; width=&quot;683&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Business architecture&lt;/b> is a description of the significant aspects of the organization. &lt;b>Application&#xD;
    architecture&lt;/b> is a description of the software applications that support the business, including how those&#xD;
    applications are used and how they interact with each other. &lt;b>Technical architecture&lt;/b> is a description of the&#xD;
    hardware infrastructure that supports the software applications.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business architecture must govern the application architecture, which in turn must govern the technical&#xD;
    architecture. This does not imply a hierarchical relationship wherein the business architecture prescribes to the&#xD;
    application architecture, and the application architecture prescribes to technical architecture. Rather, it means that&#xD;
    goals and constraints (called drivers) are communicated in one direction, and any architectural decisions (called&#xD;
    tradeoffs) that affect the governing architecture must be made at the level of the governing architecture. An&#xD;
    architectural goal implies a desired condition, while an architectural constraint implies mandatory compliance.&#xD;
    However, even constraints can be intentionally ignored. For example, a constraint that requires the business to comply&#xD;
    with certain legislation might be ignored because the cost of making the changes necessary to comply far exceed the&#xD;
    penalties incurred by noncompliance.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Architecting is about balancing forces and making tradeoffs to create a solution that optimally satisfies conflicting&#xD;
    requirements. This means that the business architecture defines goals and constraints that describe the support that it&#xD;
    requires from application architecture. The same applies to the application and the technical architecture. Where&#xD;
    conflicts arise, as they always do, localized sub-optimal solutions must be found in order to ensure an optimum overall&#xD;
    solution. When these decisions have a broad impact, they are termed &lt;b>architectural issues&lt;/b> and must be formally&#xD;
    agreed to by stakeholders represented by an architecture board.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These different architectures must always be considered when communicating with stakeholders. Discussing only one of&#xD;
    them with an individual who does not understand its form, application, or notation results in ineffective&#xD;
    communication. Furthermore, it can cause that individual to misunderstand the consequences of his or her decisions&#xD;
    regarding the other architectures. The impact of decisions in one of the architectures must be translated to the other&#xD;
    ones. This helps stakeholders understand the benefits and disadvantages of tradeoffs, which leads to architectural&#xD;
    alignment. Architectural alignment helps us understand the consequences of decisions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Business Architecture is a Framework for Change&quot; name=&quot;Business Architecture is a Framework for Change&quot;>Business&#xD;
    Architecture as a Framework for Change&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; alt=&quot;To top of page&quot; src=&quot;../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;26&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business architecture is what we use to communicate with different stakeholders about the business to ensure a&#xD;
    common, consistent understanding. We can describe the business architecture as the framework within which we make&#xD;
    changes to the organization to enable the business to ultimately realize the business idea, as shown in the figure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Image described by content&quot; src=&quot;resources/co_barc2.gif&quot; width=&quot;473&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Architectural Views&quot; name=&quot;Architectural Views&quot;>Business Architectural Views&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;To top of page&quot; src=&quot;../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Because business architecture is complex and difficult to measure, we divide it into a number of different views. Much&#xD;
    as the software architecture is defined in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/software_architecture_4269A354.html&quot; guid=&quot;3.066252221588648E-305&quot;>Concept:&#xD;
    Software Architecture&lt;/a>, the architectural views of the business will be defined here.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each view describes one aspect of the entire business. It therefore contains an architecturally significant subset of&#xD;
    what would be a complete definition. In other words, an architectural view contains the 20% that really matters to that&#xD;
    aspect of the business [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>ROY98&lt;/a>].&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The architectural views are helpful in discussing the business architecture with different stakeholders. Because each&#xD;
    stakeholder has one or several views that are of particular interest, he or she can focus on those aspects of the&#xD;
    organization that are associated with those views without having to understand everything else as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that not all views apply to all situations. Some views can be ignored when they add no value, and sometimes it&#xD;
    might be necessary to define new views. Here are some typical business architectural views:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Market View&lt;/b> describes the markets in which the business operates, customer profiles and offerings, or the&#xD;
        products and services that the business offers to customers in the target markets.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Business Process View&lt;/b> describes the significant goals of the business and outlines the key business use&#xD;
        cases that support these goals.&amp;nbsp;When business use cases are used to document business processes, this view is&#xD;
        called the Business Use Case View.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Organization View&lt;/b> describes the groupings of roles and responsibilities within the business and the&#xD;
        realization of business use cases.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Human Resource View&lt;/b> describes remuneration profiles and incentive mechanisms, key cultural characteristics&#xD;
        and mechanisms, competence profiles, and education and training mechanisms.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Domain View&lt;/b> describes the major business concepts and information structures used by the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Geographic View&lt;/b> describes the distribution of organizational structure, function and resources&amp;nbsp;across&#xD;
        physical locations such as cities and countries.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Communication View&lt;/b> describes the communication pathways within the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Mapping of the Business Architectural Views to RUP Viewpoints&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    RUP Viewpoints are described in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/system_architecture_5F3B1E17.html&quot; guid=&quot;_1om3AOM9EdmaZcY4PeqVxA&quot;>Concept:&#xD;
    System Architecture&lt;/a>. These viewpoints are applicable to system development generally. When the 'system' under&#xD;
    consideration is a business, the Business Architectural Views form a more pertinent specialization of the generic&#xD;
    viewpoints. The following table shows how they are related. Note that the Business Architectural Views, by the&#xD;
    definitions offered in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/system_architecture_5F3B1E17.html&quot; guid=&quot;_1om3AOM9EdmaZcY4PeqVxA&quot;>Concept:&#xD;
    System Architecture&lt;/a>, in some cases cover multiple views (where a view is the intersection of viewpoint and&#xD;
    abstraction level).&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;table style=&quot;WIDTH: 525px; HEIGHT: 650px&quot; cellspacing=&quot;2&quot; cellpadding=&quot;2&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;tbody>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>Business Architectural Views&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                &lt;strong>RUP Viewpoints&lt;/strong>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Market View&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                &lt;p>&#xD;
                    The market view defines, at least partially,&amp;nbsp;the context for the business - it focuses on actual&#xD;
                    and potential products and services offered to customers in the chosen markets. It maps to the&#xD;
                    intersection of the &lt;em>Logical Viewpoint&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Context Level&lt;/em>. For the purposes of the &lt;a&#xD;
                    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
                    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_architecture_document_A73E67D4.html&quot;&#xD;
                    guid=&quot;{D3A0CA96-30AD-4461-9386-A3EC9A7E879F}&quot;>Artifact: Business Architecture Document&lt;/a>, the Market&#xD;
                    View is limited to those factors that impact the architecture, and areas where changes to the&#xD;
                    architecture would affect performance in chosen markets.&#xD;
                &lt;/p>&#xD;
                &lt;p>&#xD;
                    More general discussion of markets and the rationale for business strategy choices is found in &lt;a&#xD;
                    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_vision_55FFBD95.html&quot;&#xD;
                    guid=&quot;{C1A31211-2C05-4665-8DC5-6BFB63F4FCE4}&quot;>Artifact: Business Vision&lt;/a>.&#xD;
                &lt;/p>&#xD;
                &lt;p>&#xD;
                    The Market View may be used to set new &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
                    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_goal_D99D08F9.html&quot;&#xD;
                    guid=&quot;{6DC6732B-E7F1-495E-B5EC-AEBFD7BE80FE}&quot;>Artifact: Business Goal&lt;/a>s, which, in turn,&amp;nbsp;may&#xD;
                    influence the Business Architecture.&#xD;
                &lt;/p>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Business Process View&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                This mapping is straightforward - to the intersection of the &lt;em>Process Viewpoint&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Context&#xD;
                Level.&lt;/em>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Organization View&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                The organization view is about the way the business is structured to realize business use cases, not about&#xD;
                positional or staff hierarchies and networks. You would expect, for example,&amp;nbsp;to see collaborations of&#xD;
                &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_system_BB28EEB.html&quot;&#xD;
                guid=&quot;{4064F184-314B-4965-9F08-6AE5DBF6205A}&quot;>Artifact: Business System&lt;/a>s in this view. It therefore&#xD;
                maps to the intersection of the &lt;em>Logical Viewpoint&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Analysis Level&lt;/em>.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Human Resource View&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                The human resource view extends the &lt;em>Worker Viewpoint,&lt;/em> potentially at all levels, most&#xD;
                significantly at the &lt;em>Context Level&lt;/em> where policy is defined, but at &lt;em>Analysis&lt;/em> and&#xD;
                &lt;em>Design Levels&lt;/em> too, with, for example,&amp;nbsp;the application of competence profiles.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Domain View&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                The domain view maps fairly well to the intersection of the &lt;em>Information Viewpoint&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Context&#xD;
                Level.&lt;/em>&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
        &lt;tr>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                Geographic View and Communication View&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td>&#xD;
                These views together map to the intersection of the &lt;em>Distribution Viewpoint&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Context&#xD;
                Level&lt;/em> (the &lt;em>Enterprise Locality View&lt;/em>), with localities relating to the geographic aspect and&#xD;
                connectors to the communication aspect.&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
