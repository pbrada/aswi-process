    Once an enterprise has analyzed its mission and defined its goals, it needs a way to measure progress toward those&#xD;
    goals. Many things contribute to organization's success. Those that are key contributors such as Key Performance&#xD;
    Indicators (KPIs), also known as Key Success Indicators (KSIs) or Key Business Indicators (KBIs), are used by&#xD;
    businesses to define and measure progress toward their goals. In SOMA, KPIs represent quantifiable measurable&#xD;
    objectives, agreed to beforehand, that reflect the critical success factors of an organization.&#xD;
