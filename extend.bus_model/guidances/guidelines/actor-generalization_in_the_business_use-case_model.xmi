    Several business actors can play the same role in a particular business use case. Thus, both a Business Traveler and a&#xD;
    Tourist are seen as the same external entity by the business use case that handles the check-in. The shared role is&#xD;
    modeled as a business actor, Passenger, inherited by the two original business actors. We show these relationships with&#xD;
    generalizations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    The actors Business Traveler and Tourist inherit all the attributes of a Passenger. Thus, both these actors can act as&#xD;
    Passengers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On the other hand, one business user can play several different roles in relation to the business, which means that the&#xD;
    user can correspond to several business actors. If this is the general behavior of this kind of user, the model may&#xD;
    become clearer if the user is represented by one business actor who inherits several business actors. Each inherited&#xD;
    business actor represents one of the user?s roles relative to the business.&#xD;
