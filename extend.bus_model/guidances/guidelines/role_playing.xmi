    Each member of the group is assigned a role that is of interest to the system. Roles are users, the system
    itself, other systems, and sometimes entities that are maintained by the system. The group then walks
    through how the system is used. Along the way, there will be discussions about who is responsible for
    what-take notes on the responsibilities of each role. Having the system analyst play the role of the user
    or customer helps gain real insights into the problem domain.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    As a frame work for the role play, you may perform scripted walkthroughs of how the system is used. If you
    have some use cases outlined, you can use them as a basis for the script. The walkthrough can also be
    performed at a business level, using the business use cases as a basis for the script.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Another technique often combined with role playing is Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) cards.
