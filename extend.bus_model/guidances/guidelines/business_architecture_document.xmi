&lt;p>&#xD;
    The References section of the Business Architecture Document presents external documents that provide background&#xD;
    information important to understanding the business architecture. If there are a large number of references, structure&#xD;
    the section in subsections, for example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        external documents&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        internal documents&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business architecture is formed by considering what is needed to improve, or re-engineer, the key business&#xD;
    processes. These processes are represented by business use cases, that form a subset of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_use_case_model_EC79264C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{89BEF367-5875-47E0-97D6-23E5BCCE52B8}&quot;>Business Use Case Model&lt;/a>. Another important input is the business&#xD;
    goals, also captured in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_use_case_model_EC79264C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{89BEF367-5875-47E0-97D6-23E5BCCE52B8}&quot;>Business Use Case Model&lt;/a>. It is not necessary to describe &lt;i>all&lt;/i>&#xD;
    the business goals here-only the architecturally significant ones. The following are examples of characteristics that&#xD;
    may determine whether or not a business goal is architecturally significant:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is critical for the long-term success of the enterprise.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It contributes heavily to the business strategy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It cannot be realized with current process, resources, and infrastructure.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Changing it would have sweeping effects on the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is influenced by external parties over which the business has no direct control.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, these are not the only influences that shape the business architecture. There also will be constraints imposed&#xD;
    by the environment in which the business must operate, by the need to reuse existing assets, by the imposition of&#xD;
    various standards, and so on. These macro-level forces (&lt;b>drivers&lt;/b>) are said to shape the business architecture&#xD;
    because they have significant influence on what the business does and the way in which it operates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Architectural drivers&lt;/b> is the collective name for architectural &lt;b>goals&lt;/b> and &lt;b>constraints&lt;/b>. An&#xD;
    architectural goal describes a desire or intent of the business architecture, while an architectural constraint imposes&#xD;
    a restriction. Clearly defining architectural goals enables the business to take advantage of the forces affecting the&#xD;
    business; clearly defining architectural constraints reduces risk by restricting alternatives. Consider, for example,&#xD;
    the strategic focus (operational excellence, customer intimacy, or product innovation), the availability of human or&#xD;
    other resources, current and expected economic conditions, technology trends, changing customer behavior, competitor&#xD;
    movements, the state of the markets in which the business operates, globalization, economic migration, and legislation&#xD;
    and regulation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also consider key quality dimensions of the business that shape the business architecture. The information presented&#xD;
    may include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        operating performance requirements&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        quality targets, such as &quot;all shipments delivered on-time&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        extensibility targets, such as ability to meet growing customer demands&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        portability targets, such as supported countries, languages, and product lines&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;The Business Process View&quot; name=&quot;The Business Process View&quot;>The Business Process View&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Process View, which includes the key business processes, is a subset of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_use_case_model_EC79264C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{89BEF367-5875-47E0-97D6-23E5BCCE52B8}&quot;>Artifact: Business Use Case Model&lt;/a>. It describes the set of business&#xD;
    scenarios and business use cases that:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        represent some significant, central capability of the business&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        have a substantial coverage, meaning that that they exercise many key elements of the organization&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        stress or illustrate a specific, delicate, complex, or risky point of the business architecture&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The United States General Accounting Office [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>GAO97&lt;/a>] lists some&#xD;
    criteria for prioritizing business process:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        processes with the strongest link to business strategy&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        process that have the highest impact on customers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        processes with the biggest potential return on improvement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        processes for which there is strong consensus on the need for change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        processes that can be redesigned with the currently available resources and infrastructure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        less-complex processes that can be improved quickly (quick wins)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        less-complex processes that can be used to gain experience in re-engineering&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each significant business use case, include a subsection containing the following information:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the name of the Business use case&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a brief description of the business use case, including its purpose&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a description of &lt;i>why&lt;/i> the Business use case is considered architecturally significant&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;The Organization Structure View&quot; name=&quot;The Organization Structure View&quot;>The Organization View&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Organization View is initially a subset of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_analysis_model_9449F63A.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{CF53445C-3351-46C6-810E-8251830029A7}&quot;>Artifact: Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>, including elements that are&#xD;
    significant to the business architecture. As the Business Analysis Model is refined into the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_design_model_E75F0498.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_Yi4dsBpWEdqUwb9RAn2tTA&quot;>Artifact: Business Design Model&lt;/a>, the Organization View shifts with it, to show how&#xD;
    abstract roles in the business are bound to people, software and hardware.&amp;nbsp;This enables quantitative reasoning&#xD;
    about business operational performance and costs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Organization View&amp;nbsp;describes the most important business workers, business entities and business events, their&#xD;
    grouping into business systems, and the organization of these into layers. It also includes the most important business&#xD;
    use-case realizations and descriptions of general patterns of behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The scope of this view can be the business itself (the internal organization) or the business and its relationship to&#xD;
    its partners (the extended organization).&amp;nbsp; This last viewpoint is particularly interesting if you want to consider&#xD;
    the entire value chain involved in delivering products and services to customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Human Resources Aspects View&quot; name=&quot;Human Resources Aspects View&quot;>The Human Resource View&lt;/a> &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Human Resource view covers all aspects of preparing an organization for change. The results include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a recommended infrastructure&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        mechanisms for motivating employees to work in the changed organization&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        mechanisms for encouraging the necessary skills in the changed organization&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to quickly arrive at a well-functioning organization, this work can be started long before the final business&#xD;
    design has been found. Early in a project, in the initial iterations before the objectives for the effort are stable,&#xD;
    the work focuses on generally preparing the staff for change. Later in the project, the work instead focuses on&#xD;
    educating the employees in their new tasks and investigating the needs for infrastructure changes; for example, where&#xD;
    people are located and what equipment they need. If the business-modeling effort results in massive changes, such as in&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_reengineering_8A1CC1F0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x87h-dnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business re-engineering&lt;/a>, preparing for change might be such a complex and costly&#xD;
    task that it is treated as a separate project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Kotter's change model [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>KOT96&lt;/a>], which has&#xD;
    been successfully used by a number of organizations, defines the following steps for leading an organization through&#xD;
    change:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Establish a sense of urgency.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a guiding coalition.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Develop a vision and strategy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communicate the vision.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Empower broad-based action.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Generate quick wins.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consolidate gains and produce more change.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Institutionalize new approaches.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    More specifically, you need to consider the following aspects of change:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Understanding%20Organizational%20Culture&quot;>understanding organizational culture&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Managing%20concerns%20and%20attitudes&quot;>managing concerns and attitudes&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Changing%20and%20improving%20skills&quot;>changing and improving skills&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;#Defining%20Incentives%A0&quot;>defining incentives&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Understanding Organizational Culture&quot; name=&quot;Understanding Organizational Culture&quot;>Understanding Organizational&#xD;
    Culture&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To succeed with a change and make it permanent, you must also understand, and possibly change, the culture of the&#xD;
    target organization. If you fail to understand the culture of the target organization, any &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_engineering_744E8794.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x8onANnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business engineering&lt;/a> effort will fail.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Even if your business-modeling effort is not aimed at any radical change, the culture is important to understand-enough&#xD;
    so that you can avoid introducing elements to the organization that disturb it in an unexpected way.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Culture is not something you can touch or describe with a simple formula.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Champy [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>CHM95&lt;/a>] characterizes the culture of a healthy business as a culture of &quot;willingness.&quot;&#xD;
    Specifically, Champy suggests that employees in a new business must be willing to do the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        always perform to the highest measure of competence&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        take initiatives and risks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        adapt to change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        make decisions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        work cooperatively as a team&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        be open, especially with information, knowledge, and news of forthcoming or actual &quot;problems&quot;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        trust and be trustworthy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        respect others, including customers, suppliers, colleagues, and themselves&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        answer for their actions and accept responsibility&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        judge and be judged, to reward and be rewarded, on the basis of performance&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is not easy to change a business' culture, or any culture for that matter. This alone is the subject of entire&#xD;
    books. Again, Champy [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>CHM95&lt;/a>] provides the&#xD;
    inspiration for a brief description of the recommended procedure:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine the shared values of the people in the existing business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify and weed out bad behavior.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Articulate what values and behaviors you want.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine if your management use cases support your aspirations for certain values and behaviors. If they do not,&#xD;
        it is impossible to change the culture.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Install new values by teaching, doing, and living according to them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The path to a changed culture is full of traps. Repeated here are four of the &quot;don'ts&quot; that Champy [&lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>CHM95&lt;/a>] warns against:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Don't tolerate people who refuse to change their behavior, especially if their work is important to achieving your&#xD;
        engineering goals. When you tolerate old behaviors, it signals that you are not serious about change. This applies&#xD;
        to everyone-managers and team members alike.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Don't expect people to change how they behave unless you arrange their work to allow them to act differently.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Don't expect immediate cultural change. A complete cultural change takes a few years, not a few months.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Don't delay engineering the management use cases to support the new set of values.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Managing concerns and attitudes&quot; name=&quot;Managing concerns and attitudes&quot;>Managing Concerns and&#xD;
    Attitudes&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Areas to consider are:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business idea and strategies-are they explained well and understood by everyone?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Functionally oriented versus process-oriented organization-are you changing to a process oriented organization,&#xD;
        and, in that case, are the benefits explained and understood?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The coming change-change is less threatening if you explain what it entails, and also what is motivating it. The&#xD;
        change should be motivated not just from the perspective of the members of the business, but also from the&#xD;
        perspective the customers.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business culture-does the culture support the proposed changes?&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Changing and improving skills&quot; name=&quot;Changing and improving skills&quot;>Changing and Improving Skills&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are needs for education at several levels and we have chosen to show three categories. For general skills and for&#xD;
    some domain-specific skills, you may find externally available programs. For skills that are more specific to your&#xD;
    organization, you need to develop and plan for presentations, workshops, and, in some cases, more extensive training&#xD;
    programs.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    General skills:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A process-oriented organization is focused on the customer. You may need to build an awareness of the difference&#xD;
        between delivering value to the customer and just following procedures.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Responsibilities are distributed to the individuals working in the processes, which might require that you make&#xD;
        sure everyone clearly understands enough of the business rules to make the right decisions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    Domain-specific skills:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do you have a general understanding of the business, including products and services?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What business actors (customers, partners, vendors) are involved?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What results are produced and what services are delivered?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How is this related to your work responsibilities within the processes?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business-process specific skills:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You need a good knowledge of the process or processes of the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You need a good knowledge of the responsibilities defined for the business workers that you will act as, along with&#xD;
        an ability to perform the tasks of the business worker.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You need an understanding of your colleagues' responsibilities and tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        You need a knowledge of how to use the business tools.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Achieving the right skills within the organization may be the result of a combination of training existing employees&#xD;
    and hiring new people.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Defining Incentivesnbsp;&quot; name=&quot;Defining Incentives&amp;nbsp;&quot;>Defining Incentives&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Define a reward system that encourages employees to work in the direction of the business idea and business strategy to&#xD;
    satisfy the needs of the served actors. With the goals of the individual business processes, which as a starting point&#xD;
    should be based on business ideas and strategies, define rewards related to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        overall performance of the business&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        overall performance of the business process&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        results of the individual execution (instance) of a business process&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        contributions of each individual&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Investigate existing incentives for all kinds of employees in the target organization. Rewards in a functionally&#xD;
    oriented organization are often related to the individual functional organization unit, which fails to capture that it&#xD;
    is the overall result of the business and its business processes that are the essential aspects. Such incentives need&#xD;
    to be replaced as soon as possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A smooth transfer from the old to the new reward system, however, is essential for the acceptance of changes among the&#xD;
    employees.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a prerequisite for success, the staff members must have the right equipment, and that equipment must be optimally&#xD;
    located in relation to their tasks.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Geographic View&quot; name=&quot;Geographic View&quot;>The Geographic View&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot; alt=&quot;To top of page&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In a service industry, optimal location is often relatively easy to arrange, whereas in a manufacturing company, the&#xD;
    changes in a business process might become both expensive and extensive. The budget and the available time frame often&#xD;
    limit what is possible to achieve on a single project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The importance of the location varies between different kinds of processes. A tele-sales process, a field sales&#xD;
    process, and a manufacturing process significantly differ in this respect. The possibility for a business-engineering&#xD;
    effort to affect where and how the organization will be located in the future also differs significantly between&#xD;
    projects.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following procedure helps determine a realistic approach:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Look at each business use case to see how the involved business workers should be physically located in order to&#xD;
        optimally perform the tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Look at the use-case realizations, one by one, to identify the needs of equipment and premises for each business&#xD;
        worker.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Look at the whole business, or a group of related business use cases, and consider: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Which business workers participate in several business use cases?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Which processes make use of each other's results?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        With this as a basis, identify the optimal location of each business worker.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Compare this with the current situation and ask yourself: &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is a realistic change within the mandate of the project?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is the most cost-effective location?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What is mandatory? What can the organization live without?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What can be compensated for by having the right equipment?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                What can be compensated for by having the right location?&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consider the effect of relocating an entire business system on the business use cases.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Estimate the cost per business use case to change the location according to what you have discovered. Determine&#xD;
        whether the investment is realistic.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, a mobile data solution must be considered for a sales person who needs direct access to company databases&#xD;
    while at the customer's offices. Having video-conferencing equipment installed sometimes compensates for the&#xD;
    disadvantage of having the members of a development team located at different sites.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Architectural Tradeoffs&quot; name=&quot;Architectural Tradeoffs&quot;>Architectural Tradeoffs&lt;img height=&quot;20&quot;&#xD;
    alt=&quot;To top of page&quot; src=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/resources/top.gif&quot; width=&quot;26&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This section of the Business Architecture Document describes the how the business architecture realizes the&#xD;
    architectural goals and constraints (&lt;b>architectural drivers&lt;/b>) described near the beginning of this document. It is&#xD;
    a discussion for preserving the rationale underlying architectural decisions. Most, or at least many, architectural&#xD;
    drivers are conflicting, and the business architecture must therefore provide an optimal solution that satisfies the&#xD;
    greatest number of conflicting drivers to the greatest possible extent. This implies that tradeoffs and decisions will&#xD;
    have to be made. It is these decisions and tradeoffs that are described here.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As an example, one architectural goal may be the ability to rapidly deploy new products, while another architectural&#xD;
    goal may be the ability to deliver products via partners with complementary offerings. These two goals are conflicting,&#xD;
    because delivering product via external partners implies a longer time-to-market. In such a case, this section would&#xD;
    describe the tradeoffs made within the business architecture to achieve the maximum of both these goals.&amp;nbsp; In this&#xD;
    example, a partner product management team might be created, and certain restrictions might be applied to the selection&#xD;
    of candidate partners.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many conflicts and tradeoffs will surface only after the application architecture or technical architecture is&#xD;
    considered (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/business_architecture_D437B035.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.6275891002471178E-306&quot;>Concept:&#xD;
    Business Architecture&lt;/a>). It is essential that the consequences of these decisions be clearly understood.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This section presents both the rationale for the overall architectural shape of the business (as captured initially in&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_analysis_model_9449F63A.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{CF53445C-3351-46C6-810E-8251830029A7}&quot;>Artifact: Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;and &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_deployment_model_2392BF2E.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_lm_NMBpWEdqUwb9RAn2tTA&quot;>Artifact: Business Deployment Model&lt;/a>), and the rationale for the later realization&#xD;
    choices&amp;nbsp;in terms of people, software and hardware (presented in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_design_model_E75F0498.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Yi4dsBpWEdqUwb9RAn2tTA&quot;>Artifact:&#xD;
    Business Design Model&lt;/a>) - if these are thought to be architecturally significant.&#xD;
