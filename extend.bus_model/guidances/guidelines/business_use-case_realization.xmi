&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use-case model describes a business in terms of business actors and business use cases, corresponding, for&#xD;
    example,&amp;nbsp;to customers and business processes. The business use-case model includes workflow descriptions that&#xD;
    identify &lt;b>what&lt;/b> is done. &lt;b>How&lt;/b> the work is performed in each business use case is described in the business&#xD;
    analysis model, and, in particular, in business use-case realizations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The set of&amp;nbsp;business systems and business workers which perform&amp;nbsp;the work of a business use case, together with&#xD;
    the business&amp;nbsp;entities they access and manipulate as part of the process, and a description of the interaction, is&#xD;
    called the business use-case realization. Instances of the same class (of business system, business worker or business&#xD;
    entity) can participate in several different business use-case realizations, reflecting that the same kind of resource&#xD;
    from time to time&amp;nbsp;participates in different processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business systems form a containment hierarchy for the business workers and business entities (and conceivably other&#xD;
    business systems), so you might expect that interactions by business systems would only occur only with other business&#xD;
    systems. In fact you are not prohibited from showing interactions between business systems and business workers, for&#xD;
    example, when you want to drill down inside a particular business system and expose its business workers and their&#xD;
    interactions with each other and external business systems, when realizing a business use case. However, if you decide&#xD;
    that a business system should&amp;nbsp;present a well-defined boundary and interfaces in the business, you would not expose&#xD;
    its contents in this way when realizing a business use case. Rather, you would derive &lt;em>subordinate&lt;/em> business use&#xD;
    cases for that business system (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/modeling_large_organizations_DB7556B6.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;1.268342166757605E-304&quot;>Concept: Modeling Large Organizations&lt;/a>) and describe, at a&amp;nbsp;subordinate level, how&#xD;
    these are realized by collaborations of the internal resources of the business system.&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The first choice to document the realization of a business use case is to draw an activity diagram, where swimlanes (or&#xD;
    partitions) represent the participating business systems or business workers. For each business use-case realization,&#xD;
    there may be one or more activity diagrams to illustrate the workflow. A common way to organize is to have one overview&#xD;
    diagram without swimlanes that cover the whole workflow, and where you show activities that are at a high level. Then,&#xD;
    for each such activity there is a more detailed activity diagram that shows the swimlanes and the tasks at the business&#xD;
    worker level. For readability reasons, a goal should be that each diagram fit on a page.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each business use-case realization there can be one or more interaction diagrams depicting its participating&#xD;
    business systems, business workers and business entities, and their interactions. There are two types of interaction&#xD;
    diagrams: Sequence diagrams and communication diagrams. They express similar information, but show it in different&#xD;
    ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Sequence diagrams (as their name implies) show an explicit sequence of events and are better than activity diagrams&#xD;
        for more complex scenarios.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Communication diagrams show the communication links and messages between objects and are better for understanding&#xD;
        all of the effects on a given object.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If alternative flows are few, but there are many business entities involved, interaction diagrams are often a&#xD;
        better choice than the activity diagram to show the realization of the workflow.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    For each business use-case realization there may be one or more component diagrams or class diagrams depicting its&#xD;
    participating business systems, business workers and business entities. A diagram of this kind can be a useful help&#xD;
    when coordinating all the requirements on a business system, business worker or business entity that participates in&#xD;
    several business use-case realizations. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;How to Map Use-Case Relationships&quot; name=&quot;How to Map Use-Case Relationships&quot;>How to Map Use-Case&#xD;
    Relationships&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Relationships between business use cases correspond to relationships in the business analysis model. By studying what&#xD;
    happens in the business, you can understand how to map the business use-case relationships to links between objects of&#xD;
    the business use-case realizations. For more on use-case relationships, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;3.9905535055726305E-306&quot;>Guideline: Business Use-Case Model&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Suppose a business use case (base) includes another business use case (inclusion). At a given moment, the employees&#xD;
    will need to cease following the instructions of the base and switch to following the instructions of the inclusion as&#xD;
    described in the documentation of the respective business use-case realizations. The following happens:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An identifiable state is reached in the execution of a process according to the base use case-a business worker has&#xD;
        finished a certain task for example.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A change in state is noticed by someone who is ready to start working according to the realization of the&#xD;
        inclusion. Either the person sees some phenomenon, or is informed by someone in the inclusion.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business worker in the realization of the base interacts with the business workers in the realization of the&#xD;
    inclusion to inform them of what is going on. The most natural modeling approach is:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A realization of the inclusion has one object for each base it is included by. The objects originating from the&#xD;
        base each have a link to the business worker individual that starts the work in the inclusion.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;160&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bucr1.gif&quot; width=&quot;455&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Each business worker in the realization of the base business use cases needs a link to the business worker that starts&#xD;
    the work according the inclusion business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A realization of the base business use case does not have objects representing the inclusion.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the case of a business use case being extended by an another business use case, you will end up with a similar&#xD;
    solution. In the realization of the extension, you will have one object representing the base, that has a link to an&#xD;
    object initiating the work described within the extension.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;167&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bucr2.gif&quot; width=&quot;328&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Each business worker in the base business use cases needs a link to the business worker that starts the extension.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For use-case-generalization, the solution is again similar. In the realization of the parent use case, you will see an&#xD;
    object representing the child.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;177&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bucr3.gif&quot; width=&quot;439&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    There are business workers representing the child use cases in the realization of the parent.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The use-case relationships have different interpretations. When it comes to their representations in the business&#xD;
    analysis model, the difference is found in why the work defined in the inclusion, the extension or the parent business&#xD;
    use case is initiated and how the business worker interprets the information. How the objects in the business use-case&#xD;
    realizations interact follow the same structure in all cases.&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The participating business systems, business workers and business entities perform the business use-case workflow,&#xD;
        including all alternative and optional subflows.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Workflow description covers all the tasks described.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The business systems, business workers and business entities have all the relationships needed to perform the&#xD;
        business use-case workflow.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        At least one business system or business worker handling the interaction between the business actors and the&#xD;
        business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
