&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business actors interact with the business by sending and receiving messages. Both parties can take the initiative to&#xD;
    interact.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To fully understand the role of a business actor, you must know in which processes the actor is involved. This is shown&#xD;
    in by the communicate-association between the business actor and the business use case representing the process. The&#xD;
    communicate-association indicates the existence of an interaction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The multiplicity of the association shows how many instances of a business use case one instance of a business actor&#xD;
    can interact with at the same time; conversely, it shows how many instances of a business actor one instance of a&#xD;
    business use case can interact with.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    When an instance of the business actor Passenger approaches the check-in counter and hands over his ticket and baggage,&#xD;
    he sends a message to an instance of the use case Individual Check-in. At the end of the check-in procedure, the&#xD;
    business use case will print out and hand over a boarding pass, and one or more customer claim checks to the passenger.&#xD;
    The Passenger can only communicate with one instance of Individual Check-in. Thus, the multiplicity of the relationship&#xD;
    is [1].&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;52&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bcomm1.gif&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    A Passenger who wants to check-in at the airport will interact with the use case Individual Check-in.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When an actor and a use case interact, it can be done using different media. For example, telephone, fax, mail, and&#xD;
    e-mail. One or several messages can be sent, but there is only one communicate-association between the two.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
