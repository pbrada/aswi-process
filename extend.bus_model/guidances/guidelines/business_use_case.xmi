    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_business_use_case__categories_of&quot; name=&quot;XE_business_use_case__categories_of&quot;>&lt;/a>The processes of a business&#xD;
    are defined as a number of different business use cases, each of which represents a specific workflow in the business.&#xD;
    A business use case defines what should happen in the business when it is performed; it describes the performance of a&#xD;
    sequence of actions that produces a valuable result to a particular business actor. A business process either generates&#xD;
    value for the business or mitigates costs to the business.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    A passenger can either travel individually or with a group. When traveling with a group, a passenger is accompanied by&#xD;
    a tour guide.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use case describes &quot;a sequence of actions performed in a business that produces a result of observable value&#xD;
    to an individual actor of the business&quot;. Hence, from an individual actor's perspective, a business use case defines the&#xD;
    complete workflow that produces the desired results. This is similar to what is generally called a &quot;business process&quot;,&#xD;
    but &quot;a business use case&quot; has a much more precise definition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The definition of the business use case concept contains a number of keywords, which are essential to understanding&#xD;
    what a business use case is:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business use case instance - the definition above is really describing a specific business workflow; that is, an&#xD;
        instance. In reality, there are a great number of possible workflows, many of them very similar.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        To make the use-case model understandable, similar workflows are grouped together into a business use case-a&#xD;
        &quot;class&quot; in terms of the object model. To identify and describe a business use case means to identify and describe&#xD;
        the class-like business use case, not the individual use case instances. Thus a business use case will define&#xD;
        decision points and alternative flows; which path is taken will depend on the state of the business, business&#xD;
        events,&amp;nbsp;and input from the business actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An individual actor - The actor is probably the real key to finding the correct business use case. Starting with&#xD;
        individual actors-or really instances of actors-helps avoid business use cases that are too large or complex.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        When determining suitable actors, first try to name at least two or three different people who could perform as the&#xD;
        actor in question, then critically evaluate the support each individual requires. For example, suppose you&#xD;
        initially identify an actor called &quot;customer&quot;. Later, as you look deeper into the support each individual customer&#xD;
        requires, you might find three rather different customers: the normal &quot;user&quot; of the product, the &quot;purchaser&quot; and&#xD;
        the &quot;evaluator&quot;, who are competent to compare the product with its competitors. Each of these may require a&#xD;
        separate business use case because they represent different roles that can be played in the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A result of observable value - This expression is very important in determining the correct extent of a business&#xD;
        use case, which should be neither too small nor too big. Stating that the business use case should give a result of&#xD;
        observable value, that is, both perceived and measurable, helps you to find a complete flow, and avoid business use&#xD;
        cases that are too small.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        A good business use case helps an actor perform a task that has an identifiable value. It may be possible to put a&#xD;
        price on a successfully performed business use case. A too-small business use case will have a limited scope, thus&#xD;
        also little re-engineering potential.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In a business - The words &quot;actions performed in a business&quot;, means both that the business provides the business use&#xD;
        case to the actor, and that the business use case only covers what is actually done within the business. Supporting&#xD;
        work done elsewhere is not included.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Action - The actions are invoked either on request from an actor to the business or at a certain point in time.&#xD;
        Actions include internal tasks and decisions, as well as requests to either the invoked actor or other actors.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business use cases&amp;nbsp;specify the interactions between the subject business and its (external) business actors,&#xD;
    &lt;em>and the effect that they have on the business&lt;/em> - the performance of a business use case may change the state of&#xD;
    the business (and thus may change the way the business responds to future events or interactions), and the business use&#xD;
    case must specify these state changes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What the business directly and explicitly provides to its environment are &lt;em>services&lt;/em> (the business from this&#xD;
    perspective is simply the top level Business System and should therefore encapsulate its resources and provide&#xD;
    well-defined services to its environment -&amp;nbsp;see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_system_4B3288B3.html&quot; guid=&quot;5.503233494422666E-306&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business System&lt;/a>), and the interaction between the Business Actor and the business, as described in the Business Use&#xD;
    Case, will take place through the invocation of one or more of those services. Note that for new business development&#xD;
    (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_creation_ABCA16F6.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x8e2CdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business creation&lt;/a>, for example), or when changing the business,&amp;nbsp;Business Use&#xD;
    Cases are one way of identifying services that the business must support.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The collected set of business use cases constitute all the possible ways of using the business. See also &lt;a&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In a use-case driven business modeling project, you develop two views of the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business use case itself presents an external view of the business, which defines &lt;b>what&lt;/b> is essential to&#xD;
    perform for the business to deliver the desired results to the actor. It also defines &lt;b>what&lt;/b> interaction (the&#xD;
    business actor-business input-response sequence)&amp;nbsp;the business should have with the actors when the business use&#xD;
    case is executed. Such a view must be developed when you are deciding and agreeing on what should be done in each&#xD;
    business use case. A collection of business use cases gives an overview of the business that is very useful for&#xD;
    informing employees of what different parts of the business are doing, and what results are expected. A business use&#xD;
    case description does this without reference to the actual internal structure of the business. Note that the business&#xD;
    use case should also describe any state changes in the business that occur when it is executed, as well as any&#xD;
    significant business events raised or received. The business use case does not prescribe how business state is to be&#xD;
    established and maintained internally, or how business events are to be communicated internally - but it does specify&#xD;
    &lt;strong>what&lt;/strong> the state changes are and &lt;strong>what&lt;/strong> the significant business events are, to be able&#xD;
    to present a complete view of required business behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use-case realization, on the other hand, gives an internal view of the business use case, which defines&#xD;
    &lt;b>how&lt;/b> the work should be organized and performed in order to achieve the same desired results. A realization&#xD;
    encompasses the business workers and business entities that are involved in the execution of a business use case and&#xD;
    the relationships between them that are required to do the job. Such views must be developed to decide and agree on how&#xD;
    the work in each business use case must be organized to achieve the desired results. The Business Designer ensures that&#xD;
    there are consistent mappings between the specification (the &lt;strong>what&lt;/strong>), in the business use case, and the&#xD;
    realization (the &lt;strong>how&lt;/strong>), in the business use-case realization, for the business state changes and&#xD;
    business events, to achieve the desired behavior across &lt;em>all&lt;/em> business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Both views of the business use case are primarily intended for people within the business - the external view for&#xD;
    people who work outside the business use case, the internal view for people who work inside the business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;

    id=&quot;Classes and Instances of Business Use Cases&quot; name=&quot;Classes and Instances of Business Use Cases&quot;>Classes and&#xD;
    Instances of Business Use Cases&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a business operates, you will find that you can identify an almost unlimited number of separate workflows. A&#xD;
    use-case instance is simply a specific workflow, or scenario. It corresponds to the work that a number of collaborating&#xD;
    business members perform in their roles defined in the object model, and not to any particular business member or any&#xD;
    role that the member is playing.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use case is what you normally work with to make the use-case model understandable, and to avoid drowning in&#xD;
    details. It represents the union of a number of business use-case instances with workflows that are similar, but&#xD;
    normally not identical.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically, an employee who is competent to act in a certain role will do this in instances of several different&#xD;
    business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    At the airport check-in counter, the two business use cases, Individual Check-in and Group Check-in both require the&#xD;
    same competencies from the employee at the check-in counter, as well as access to the same information about a certain&#xD;
    departure. Thus, both use cases can and should be designed using the same Check-in Agent business worker and Departure&#xD;
    entity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_business_use_case__extent_of&quot; name=&quot;XE_business_use_case__extent_of&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a&#xD;
    id=&quot;Extent of a Business Use Case&quot; name=&quot;Extent of a Business Use Case&quot;>Extent of a Business Use Case&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is sometimes hard to decide if a service is one, or several business use cases. Apply the definition of a business&#xD;
    use case to the airport check-in process. A passenger hands his ticket and baggage to the check-in agent, who finds a&#xD;
    seat for the passenger, prints a boarding pass and starts baggage-handling. If the passenger has normal baggage, the&#xD;
    check-in agent prints baggage tag and customer claim check, and terminates the business use case by applying the tag to&#xD;
    the baggage, and giving the customer claim check, together with the boarding pass, to the passenger. If the baggage has&#xD;
    a special shape or special contents so that it cannot be transported normally, the passenger must take it to a special&#xD;
    baggage counter. If the baggage is heavy, the passenger must continue on to the airport ticket office to pay for it,&#xD;
    because check-in agents do not handle money.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Do you need one business use case at the check-in counter, another at the special baggage counter and a third at the&#xD;
    ticket office? Or do you need just a single business use case? Surely, this transaction involves three different types&#xD;
    of actions. But the question is, will any of them be of value to a passenger carrying special baggage if he does not do&#xD;
    the others? No, it is only the complete procedure-from the moment the passenger approaches the check-in counter until&#xD;
    he has paid the extra charge-that has value (and that makes sense to the passenger). Thus, the complete procedure&#xD;
    involving the three different counters is a complete case of usage-a business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition to this criteria, it is practical to keep descriptions of closely related services together, so that you&#xD;
    can review them at the same time, modify them together, test them together, write manuals for them, and in general&#xD;
    manage them as a unit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Notice also that two independent business use cases can have similar beginnings.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    In an insurance company, the business use cases Handle Claim and Handle Request both start when someone (an actor)&#xD;
    makes contact with a claim handler. The claim handler and the actor exchange some information to make it clear whether&#xD;
    the actor is filing a claim or requesting some information. Then, and only then, is it possible to decide which&#xD;
    business use case is performing. Although the two business use cases have similar beginnings, they are not connected.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Name&quot; name=&quot;Name&quot;>Name&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The name of the business use case should express what happens when an instance of the business use case is performed.&#xD;
    The form of the name should therefore be active, typically described by the gerund form of the verb (Checking-in) or a&#xD;
    verb and a noun together.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The names can either describe the tasks in the business use case from an external or an internal viewpoint, for&#xD;
    instance placing an order or receiving an order. Although a business use case describes what happens within the&#xD;
    business, it is often most natural to name the business use case from its primary actor's point of view. Once you have&#xD;
    made a decision which style is to prefer in your case, you should follow the same rule for all business use cases in&#xD;
    the business model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Goals&quot; name=&quot;Goals&quot;>Goals&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The goal of a business use case should be specified from at least two perspectives:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For the business actors the business process interacts with, specify the value those business actors expect from&#xD;
        the business (external goals).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        From the perspective of the organization performing the business processes, define what the objectives are of&#xD;
        having this business process in place and what you hope to achieve by performing it (internal goals).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Performance Goals&quot; name=&quot;Performance Goals&quot;>Performance Goals&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some common metrics categories are:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Time - an approximation of the time it should take to execute the workflow, or part of the workflow.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cost - an approximation of the cost of executing the workflow, or part of the workflow.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Quality - for example, &quot;no more than 2% of products should be defective when they come off the production line&quot;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A major challenge is to understand what scenarios (business use-case instances) are relevant to measure. Criteria to&#xD;
    use are frequency of the scenario, or business relevance of the scenario. If you can determine that a particular part&#xD;
    of the workflow has importance, you may save yourself some effort by only measuring the cost or time of that&#xD;
    subflow.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Workflow - Structure&quot; name=&quot;Workflow - Structure&quot;>Workflow - Structure&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most workflows may be thought of as several subflows, which together yield the total flow. Sometimes several business&#xD;
    use cases in the business have a common subflow, or the same subflow appears in different parts of one business use&#xD;
    case. If this common behavior has any substantial volume, it should be performed by the same business workers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a subflow is substantial, common to several business use cases, and also forms an independent and naturally&#xD;
    delimited part, the model might be clearer if this behavior is partitioned out to a separate business use case. This&#xD;
    new business use case is then either included in the original use case (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/include-relationship_in_the_business_use-case_model_F3DC3A5B.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;8.096716256124967E-305&quot;>Guideline: Include-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model&lt;/a>), an extension to it&#xD;
    (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/extend-relationship_in_the_business_use-case_model_17CD0314.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;3.452362968952187E-305&quot;>Guideline: Extend-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model&lt;/a>), or a parent use case&#xD;
    to it (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/use-case-generalization_in_the_business_use-case_model_7244BA6B.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;1.7507761609726586E-307&quot;>Guideline: Use-Case-Generalization in the Business Use-Case Model&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    At the airport check-in counter, the two business use cases, Individual Check-in and Group Check-in both use the same&#xD;
    procedure to handle an individual passenger's baggage. Because the subflow is independent of the ticket handling, and&#xD;
    is logically connected, it is modeled separately in the business use case, Baggage Handling.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The workflow of a business use case can be visualized using activity diagrams, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.1. Initial Contact&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This process starts with an initial contact between the Customer and The Company. This may happen in one of the&#xD;
    following ways:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Customer contacts The Company with an inquiry or a set of requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Company decides that it has products that would add value to the Customer and revenue to The Company.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        Customer contact person,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Company contact person,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Whether this is a new customer to The Company,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Any competitive information about the proposal or bidding situation surrounding this agreement.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.2. Initial Opportunity Work&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are two main purposes of this section:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Gather customer requirements,&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide about further actions on this opportunity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The steps, Gather Preliminary customer requirements, Create sales plan (optional), and Perform Opportunity Analysis can&#xD;
    be performed in an iterative manner, and may be performed somewhat in parallel.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.2.1 Gather Preliminary Customer Requirements&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Gather both product requirements and customer business requirements by doing the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        ask the Customer&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        look at whatever customer input there is&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        perform a preliminary site survey (optional)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        look at any available customer information&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A complete set of requirements would include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        choice of technology (could be several, if the customers wants alternatives investigated)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        any product preferences&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        functional requirements (market analysis)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            building structure and environmental characteristics&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            demography&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            mobility/capacity&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            network growth projection&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            installed base information&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        timelines&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        service requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        price requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.2.2 Create Sales Plan (optional)&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Company works with the Customer to determine how it is going to propose a solution meeting the customer&#xD;
    requirements. This creation is called a sales plan, and includes the network and switch characteristics for the&#xD;
    potential solution. The strategic positioning of The Company and its network is also discussed so that we can prepare&#xD;
    for future needs.&lt;br />&#xD;
     This sales plan is then reviewed with the Customer for accuracy and completeness. It will then be used throughout the&#xD;
    proposal process as a guide when deciding which products, market packages, and line items to propose, and which&#xD;
    assumptions to make when putting together the proposal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.2.3 Perform Opportunity Analysis&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Company will obtain the high-level price and cost of the potential solution. This is done in order to understand&#xD;
    the potential value of this opportunity, not to provide an accurate dollar amount to a Customer.&lt;br />&#xD;
     The Company then looks at the customer requirements to determine:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        risks in the opportunity (product availability, competition, customer risk)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        costs compared to revenue&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        type of opportunity (simple, complex, etc.)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        probability of sales&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        anticipated number for size of sales&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        estimated schedule&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Based on this evaluation, The Company makes a decision whether or not to continue the opportunity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.3. Create Proposal Project Plan&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Company will create a plan for creating and offering the proposal. The plan will include the assignments to the&#xD;
    individuals completing the parts of the proposal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.4. Create Delivery Project Plan&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Company develops a tentative project plan for delivery of the solution based on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        time lines in customer requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        resource availability&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        factory capacity&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        new product availability&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        availability of third party products&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This project plan will be used for future factory planning.&lt;br />&#xD;
     Additionally, this project plan will be updated and modified during the Quote Process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.5. Prepare a Quote&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This flow is defined in detail in the business use case Quote Process, which is included.&lt;br />&#xD;
     The result of the Quote Process is an engineered solution that may have various levels of certainty, along with a&#xD;
    price.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.6. Compile Additional Information&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Company compiles information to respond to any inquiries (usually regarding future development of products) that&#xD;
    might be a part of the customer business requirements. This may also include information The Company thinks the&#xD;
    Customer should know. The inquiries are generally of the following types:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        technology&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            capability now&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            capability in future&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            compliance to standards&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            compliance to future standards&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        services offered now&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        services offered in the future.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.7. Analyze and Finalize the Proposal&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Company compiles a proposal that includes the following items:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the quote(s)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        marketing literature (off the shelf)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        product information (off the shelf)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        financing terms and conditions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        scheduling information&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        roll up the financial analysis to the proposal level&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        penalties and liabilities of both the Customer and The Company&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        legal 'environmental' statements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        any assumptions made when creating the solutions in the proposal&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.8. Present the Proposal&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Company presents/proposes the above information to the Customer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>1.9. Obtain Customer Decision&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Customer will give feedback on the proposal. The Company obtains an agreement from the Customer on quotes within&#xD;
    the proposal. Such an agreement may have different format depending on the character of the solution and who the&#xD;
    Customer is.&lt;br />&#xD;
     It may be:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a signed purchase order&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a verbal agreement that the Customer will submit a purchase order&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a signed contract&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a verbal agreement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a negative decision occurs when there is no decision and validity expires&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>2. Alternative Workflows&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>2.1. Business Opportunity Rejected&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If in 1.2., it turns out the business opportunity is rejected, the following actions may be taken:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        completely rejected&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        attempt joint venture with other Supplier&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        redirect to other region&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        pass the request to another distributor/Supplier&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        attempt to change customer requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>2.2. Unable to Meet Customer Requirements&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If in Perform Opportunity Analysis or Prepare a quote, The Company is unable to suggest a solution to the customer&#xD;
    requirements, then the following actions may happen:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        suggest another manufacturer's equipment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        re-evaluate the customer requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        contact The Company to find out about future products&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        attempt to change customer requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        decide to develop new products&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        seek joint venture or supplier&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        seek alternative forms of financing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        apply different discount policy&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>2.3. Critical Information Not Known&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If at any point in the Proposal Process The Company identifies some critical information not known or available then he&#xD;
    does one of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Obtain the information&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make assumption and continue&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If any assumptions are made, then they are logged and given to the Customer in an attached document in the proposal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>2.4. New/Incomplete or Incorrect General Customer Profile&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If The Company determines that the general customer profile is inaccurate for some reason, the following actions may be&#xD;
    taken.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the Customer is new, then negotiate an agreement&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Include/determine customer preferences&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine installed base&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Request an update to records&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Possibilities&quot; name=&quot;Possibilities&quot;>Possibilities&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The possibilities of a business use case should reflect the improvement potential you can see for the business use&#xD;
    case, where in the process, as well as scale. Refer to the metrics you have specified for the business use case.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Extension Points&quot; name=&quot;Extension Points&quot;>Extension Points&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An &lt;b>extension point&lt;/b> opens up the business use case to the possibility of an extension. It has a name, and a list&#xD;
    of references to one or more locations within the workflow of the business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;ul>&#xD;

        Its name and brief description are clear and easy to understand, even to people outside the business modeling team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each business use case is complete from an outside (actor's) perspective. For example, the business use case Handle&#xD;
        Claim in an insurance company starts when a customer files a claim. The Handle Claim business use case is not&#xD;
        complete unless it includes a notification about the decision from the insurance company to the customer and (if&#xD;
        appropriate) a compensatory payment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each business use case normally is involved with at least one actor. Business use cases are initiated by actors,&#xD;
        interact with actors to perform the tasks, and deliver results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is possible, but unusual, for a supporting use case not to interact with an actor*. This is true if a business&#xD;
        use case is initiated by an internal event and does not have to interact with an actor to perform its tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    *This may seem counter to the UML definition of use case, but see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html&quot;&#xD;

&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It must be clear and easy to understand, even for people outside the business modeling team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It describes the workflow, not just the purpose of the business use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It describes only those tasks that are inside the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It describes all possible tasks in the business use case. For example, what happens if a condition is met, as well&#xD;
        as what happens if it is not.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It does not mention actors who do not communicate with it. If it did mention other actors, it would make the&#xD;
        description difficult to understand and maintain.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It describes only those tasks that belong to it, not what is going on in other business use cases that work&#xD;
        parallel to it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It does not mention other business use cases with which it does not have relationships. If the business use case&#xD;
        requires that some results exist in the business before it can start, this should be described as a precondition.&#xD;
        The precondition should not have any references to the business use cases in which the result was created.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It indicates if the order of any tasks described for the business use case is not fixed.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is structured so that it is easy to read and understand.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The description clearly describes the start and end of the workflow.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each extend-relationship is described clearly so that it is obvious how and when to insert the business use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_abstract_business_use_case__characteristics_of_a_good&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is substantial. Remember, a concrete business use case must be easy to read, together with its abstract business&#xD;
        use cases. Therefore, an abstract business use case should not be too small. If an abstract business use case is&#xD;
        not substantial, it should be eliminated and its tasks should be described in the affected concrete business use&#xD;
        cases.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It contains logically related tasks.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
