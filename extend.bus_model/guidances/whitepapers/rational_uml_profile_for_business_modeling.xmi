    Abstract
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    This UML profile is a component of the Rational Unified Process&amp;reg; (RUP&amp;reg;). It presents a UML language for capturing
    Business Models and is supported by the Business Modeling Discipline in the RUP. This profile is intended to enable UML
    tools to be used in the area of business engineering. This involves diverse disciplines such as business information
    modeling, business organization modeling, and business process modeling, as well as high-level concept and goal
    modeling that act as the requirements for the activities of the business. This will form both a foundation for a new
    class of UML tools and an interchange semantic between existing UML tools and other business engineering tools. The RUP
    Business Modeling profile has recently been extended and updated to allow for the capture of more information regarding
    business context and business processes. Early versions of the RUP business modeling discipline were intended for a
    very basic capture of business information - just enough to understand the requirements for the development of an
    application supporting the business. The goal of this update is to broaden the concepts and capabilities of the profile
    to capture more information and more fidelity in the model. The Business Modeling profile is based on prior work by
    Rational Software and Objectory, and is also used as an example profile documented in the OMG UML 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4
    language specifications.&lt;br />
