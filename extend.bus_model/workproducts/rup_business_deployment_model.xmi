  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the Business Deployment Model is to capture the physical&amp;nbsp;partitioning and distribution&amp;nbsp;of the&#xD;
    business. These could be geographical locations and their characteristics, the communication channels between them and&#xD;
    their properties or other physical resources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The representation of the Business Deployment Model could be done at different levels of abstraction. The Locality&#xD;
    Model represents the initial,&amp;nbsp;abstract decomposition into physical elements. A locality expresses notionally where&#xD;
    the business takes place without defining the exact geographic location. Depending on the scope of business modeling,&#xD;
    these localities might be decomposed into finer-grained localities. As decisions are taken, the model evolves into a&#xD;
    more &quot;concrete&quot; one, capturing the different characteristics of each physical resource.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Deployment Model is also representing the mapping of the business subsytems operations (grouped around&#xD;
    interfaces) to localities. This determines the resource requirements for each locality. Based on the behavior to be&#xD;
    supported at the localities, collaborations of localities can be constructed (and represented in interaction diagrams).&#xD;
    These help characterize the connections between the localities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each locality in the System Deployment Model has an attached description of derived business supplementary requirements&#xD;
    (derived from&amp;nbsp;business supplementary specifications) which specify quality (reliability, performance, scalability,&#xD;
    usability and so forth), physical, political&amp;nbsp;and environmental requirements, and&amp;nbsp;other constraints (cost,&#xD;
    risk, and so forth). From these requirements, the actual characteristics (of each locality) are determined; obviously,&#xD;
    these are chosen to meet the explicit requirements at least, but can exceed the requirements (for example, to cope with&#xD;
    unexpected capacity demands).&#xD;
