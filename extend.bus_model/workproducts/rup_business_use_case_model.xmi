&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Use Case Model describes the direction and intent of the business. Direction is provided in the form of&#xD;
    business goals, which are derived from business strategy, while intent is expressed as the added value and means of&#xD;
    interaction with the stakeholders and customers of the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Use Case Model is used by stakeholders, business-process analysts and business designers to understand and&#xD;
    improve the way the business interacts with its environment, and by systems analysts and software architects to provide&#xD;
    context for software development. The project manager uses the Business Use Case Model to plan the content of&#xD;
    iterations during business modeling and track progress.&#xD;

    UML Representation: Model, stereotyped as &amp;lt;&amp;lt;business use-case model&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &lt;strong>Business Use Case Model&lt;/strong> may have the following &lt;strong>properties&lt;/strong>:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Introduction:&lt;/strong> A textual description that serves as a brief introduction to the model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Survey Description:&lt;/strong> A textual description that contains information not reflected by the rest of&#xD;
        the Business Use-Case Model, including typical sequences in which the business use cases are employed by users and&#xD;
        functionality not handled by the Business Use-Case Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Use-Case Packages:&lt;/strong> The packages in the model, representing a hierarchy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Goals:&lt;/strong> The business goals in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Use Cases:&lt;/strong> The business use cases in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Business Actors:&lt;/strong> The business actors in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Relationships:&lt;/strong> The relationships in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Diagrams:&lt;/strong> The diagrams in the model, owned by the packages.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Tailoring&quot; name=&quot;Tailoring&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_reengineering_8A1CC1F0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x87h-dnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>reengineer&lt;/a> the target organization, you should consider maintaining two variants of&#xD;
    the Business Use-Case Model: one that shows the business actors and business use cases of the current organization&#xD;
    (sometimes called &quot;as-is&quot;), and one that shows the target organization with new business actors and business use cases&#xD;
    (&quot;to-be&quot;).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are considering a significant redesign of the way the target organization works (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_reengineering_8A1CC1F0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x87h-dnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business reengineering&lt;/a>), this separation is needed otherwise the redesign will be&#xD;
    developed without knowing&amp;nbsp; what the proposed changes really are at the end, and you will not be able to estimate&#xD;
    the effects or costs of those changes. It is like an architect who is asked to draw up plans for changing a townhouse&#xD;
    into three flats, without having an as-is blueprint from which to work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The cost of maintaining two Business Use-Case Models is not insignificant, and you should carefully consider how much&#xD;
    effort you put into a current model. Typically, you would not do more than identify and briefly describe the business&#xD;
    use cases* and business actors. You would also briefly outline the business use cases you determine are key to the&#xD;
    effort, possibly illustrating this with a simple activity diagram. The level of detail you choose should aim at&#xD;
    providing a shared understanding of the target organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You would not need this separation in the following situations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        there is no &quot;new&quot; organization (the goal is to document an existing organization)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        there is no existing organization* (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_creation_ABCA16F6.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;_x8e2CdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business creation&lt;/a>)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See also &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/target-organization_assessment_12E226AB.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;3.597182128577358E-305&quot;>Guideline: Target-Organization Assessment&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;em>*Note: when modeling an existing organization to create an as-is model, you need to do little more than create the&#xD;
    brief descriptions of business use cases, business actors and key business events and associate these with the existing&#xD;
    business goals because you can move more directly to capturing actual current business processes that realize these&#xD;
    business use cases. The current business use cases serve as anchors to explain the purpose of the current business&#xD;
    processes. When the purpose is business creation, the new business use cases are &lt;strong>specifications&lt;/strong> for&#xD;
    achievement of the business goals, for a business that does not yet exist. Consequently, they will need much more&#xD;
    detail.&lt;/em>&#xD;
