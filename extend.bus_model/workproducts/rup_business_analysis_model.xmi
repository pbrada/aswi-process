&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of the Business Analysis Model is to describe &lt;i>how&lt;/i> business use cases are performed. The Business&#xD;
    Use-Case Model describes &lt;i>what&lt;/i> happens between business actors and the business, and makes no assumptions about&#xD;
    the structure of the business or how business use cases are realized. The Business Analysis Model, on the other hand,&#xD;
    concretely defines the services offered by the business (to be invoked by business actors in the performance of&#xD;
    business use cases), defines the internal business workers and the information they use (the business entities),&#xD;
    describes their structural organization into independent units (business systems), and defines how they interact to&#xD;
    realize the behavior described in the business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Analysis Model describes internal structure and interaction without&amp;nbsp;necessarily prescribing design&#xD;
    choices for business workers and business entities in terms of role bindings (to human workers or automated systems).&#xD;
    That is the purpose of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_design_model_E75F0498.html&quot; guid=&quot;_Yi4dsBpWEdqUwb9RAn2tTA&quot;>Business&#xD;
    Design Model&lt;/a>, into which the Business Analysis Model evolves, as automation and refactoring options are explored.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Analysis Model is used by stakeholders and business-process analysts to understand how the business&#xD;
    currently works (in as-is form), and to analyze the effect of changes to the business (in to-be form). The&#xD;
    business-process analyst is responsible for the structure and integrity of the model, while business designers are&#xD;
    responsible for detailing elements within the model. The model is also used by systems analysts for deriving system&#xD;
    requirements based on how automated systems - that is, automated business workers (usually software-intensive)&amp;nbsp;-&#xD;
    will be used as part of business processes. Software architects use the model to define a software architecture that&#xD;
    fits the organization seamlessly and to identify classes in software analysis and design models.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>
  <impactOfNotHaving>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business analysis model describes &lt;em>how&lt;/em> the business works internally to perform business functions, so the&#xD;
    model is essential when considering changes to the business processes or the organization (structure, roles and&#xD;
    responsibilities) - you will be unable to reason about such changes without this model.&#xD;
&lt;/p></impactOfNotHaving>
  <reasonsForNotNeeding>&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the objective of the business modeling effort is simply to &lt;em>specify&lt;/em> needed behavior (through Business Use&#xD;
    Cases), or to formulate a Business Vision, then the Business Analysis Model is not needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When the intention is to improve some aspect of business performance, and perhaps change the business structure or&#xD;
    business process, for example, through the introduction&amp;nbsp;of automation, then it is likely that the Business&#xD;
    Analysis Model will evolve into a Business Design Model, with choices made&amp;nbsp;about role bindings&amp;nbsp;(human,&#xD;
    software, system) to Business Workers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whether you choose to&amp;nbsp;keep and maintain two models - a Business Analysis Model and a Business Design Model -&#xD;
    depends on a number of&amp;nbsp;considerations: if the&amp;nbsp;Business Analysis Model is retained,&amp;nbsp;to be useful it&#xD;
    must&amp;nbsp;be maintained alongside the Business Design Model - and this is costly. If the business is stable, then the&#xD;
    Business Analysis Model is useful because it allows technology decisions, which&amp;nbsp;do not affect the more abstract&#xD;
    business structure, to be revisited more easily. If there is high organizational or functional churn - there may be&#xD;
    less value, because the essence of the business changes and you need a new Business Analysis Model anyway.&#xD;
&lt;/p></reasonsForNotNeeding>

        Entities input and output.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    *Note that the business itself is the top-level component (Business System), and may directly encapsulate business&#xD;
    workers, business entities etc.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Tailoring&quot; name=&quot;Tailoring&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Analysis Model is a way of expressing the business processes in terms of responsibilities, deliverables,&#xD;
    and collaborative behavior. When a new software system is to be developed or deployed, creating a Business Analysis&#xD;
    Model is mandatory in order to assess the impact of the system on the way the business works. Organizational changes&#xD;
    resulting from deploying new software are often overlooked and excluded from the Business Use Case, resulting in a&#xD;
    working software system that cannot be used.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Failure to produce a Business Analysis Model means you run the risk that software developers will give only superficial&#xD;
    attention to the way business is done. They will do what they know best, which is to design and create software in the&#xD;
    absence of business-process knowledge.&amp;nbsp; The result can be that the software systems that are built do not support&#xD;
    the needs of the business.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We have identified&amp;nbsp;four main variants for tailoring the Business Analysis Model:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;./resources/#Domain%20Modeling&quot;>Build an &quot;incomplete&quot; Business Analysis Model, including only the domain&#xD;
        entities.&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;./resources/#As-Is%20and%20To-Be%20Models&quot;>Build two versions of the Business Analysis Model, the current&#xD;
        (as-is) and the target (to-be) model.&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;./resources/#To-Be%20Model&quot;>Build the target (to-be) model.&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;a href=&quot;./resources/#Exclude%20the%20Business%20Analysis%20Model&quot;>Exclude the Business Analysis Model.&lt;/a>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can choose to develop an &quot;incomplete&quot; Business Analysis Model, focusing on explaining &quot;things&quot; and products&#xD;
    important to the business domain. Such a model does not include the responsibilities people will carry; it only&#xD;
    describes the information content of the organization. This is often referred to as a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/domain_model_AE1C599C.html&quot; guid=&quot;_yHEVZNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>domain&#xD;
    model&lt;/a>. In such a case, you would stereotype the model as &amp;lt;&amp;lt;domain model&amp;gt;&amp;gt; instead of &amp;lt;&amp;lt;business&#xD;
    analysis&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. A domain model is very useful for providing a common basis with which concepts can be clarified and&#xD;
    defined. For more information, see the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/domain_design_846FF5B2.html&quot; guid=&quot;_qr6IQE6nEduhs-ki98mFFw&quot;>Concept: Domain&#xD;
    Design&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the purpose of the business modeling effort is to do &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_reengineering_8A1CC1F0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x87h-dnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business (re-) engineering&lt;/a>, you should consider building two variants of the&#xD;
    Business Analysis Model: one that shows the current situation and one that shows the envisioned new processes (target&#xD;
    situation).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The current version of the Business Analysis Model is simply an inventory of the Business Use-Case Realizations. The&#xD;
    elements of the Business Analysis Model are not described in any detail. Typically, brief descriptions are sufficient.&#xD;
    The Business Use-case Realizations can be documented with simple activity diagrams, where swimlanes correspond to&#xD;
    elements of the Business Analysis Model.&amp;nbsp; The target version of the Business Analysis Model requires most of the&#xD;
    work. The current processes and structures need to be reconsidered and aligned with the business strategy and goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;To-Be Model&quot; name=&quot;To-Be Model&quot;>To-Be Model&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you are business modeling for &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_creation_ABCA16F6.html&quot; guid=&quot;_x8e2CdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business&#xD;
    creation&lt;/a> (a new line of business or organization, for example), there is no existing business framework from which&#xD;
    to create an as-is model. You should look for reference business architectures and processes to assist you in the&#xD;
    creation of the target model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Exclude the Business Analysis Model&quot; name=&quot;Exclude the Business Analysis Model&quot;>Exclude the Business Analysis&#xD;
    Model&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the business analysis is well understood by all stakeholders and the project team, the benefits of developing a&#xD;
    Business Analysis Model are significantly diminished. Where this occurs, the Business Analysis Model may be omitted&#xD;
    entirely. However, it is usually a good idea to develop at least a minimal Business Analysis Model to improve&#xD;
    understanding of the way the business works&amp;nbsp;among stakeholders.&#xD;
