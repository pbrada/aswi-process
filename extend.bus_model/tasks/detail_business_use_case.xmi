&lt;p>&#xD;
    The draft step-by-step description of the workflow will serve as a basis for describing the detailed workflow. However,&#xD;
    before you begin describing, you must collect information about the business use case. Form a group that includes&#xD;
    members of the project team and people from the business that work in the process. Present a business use case to the&#xD;
    group and ask the members to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the owner of the business use case. The owner is the role or person responsible for making decisions&#xD;
        regarding the performance of and improvements to the business use case. Questions regarding the current way of&#xD;
        working must be directed towards the business use case owner.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify at least ten tasks that must belong to the business use case. Brainstorm-accept every suggestion,&#xD;
        regardless of the order and size of the task.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Name at least five interactions with business actors, such as requests from a business actor and events to which&#xD;
        the business use case must react.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Organize the tasks and interactions according to time. Identify the basic workflow, and add new tasks as needed. The&#xD;
    resulting order of tasks and interactions will serve as the basis for describing the business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    During this information-gathering phase, you undoubtedly will have ideas regarding how the business workers and&#xD;
    business entities are organized. Be sure to write these ideas down and save them for later use.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you feel you have collected enough background information and arranged it in chronological order, it is time to&#xD;
    describe the workflow of the business use case in detail.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Start by describing the normal workflow of the business use case. Look at the business actors and the business use case&#xD;
    concurrently, and specify the interactions between them. When the normal workflow is described and relatively stable,&#xD;
    start describing the alternative workflows.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Follow the agreed-upon standards regarding the appearance of a business use-case workflow. For more on style, see &lt;a&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business use cases must support business goals. If it is difficult to identify the one or more business goals supported&#xD;
    by a business use case, it may be a sign that the use case is too abstract, or that the goals are not yet adequately&#xD;
    concrete. Consider all identified business goals, because the business use case may support more than one of them. Try&#xD;
    to reverse your thinking as well-for example, ask what (as yet unidentified) business goals could the business use case&#xD;
    support, given its purpose and workflow? This approach may help you discover business goals or refine existing ones.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business use case's workflow can be divided into several subflows. When the business use case is activated, its&#xD;
    subflows can combine in various ways if one of the following holds true:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The business use case can proceed from one of several possible paths, depending on the input from a given business&#xD;
        actor or the values of some attribute or object. For example, the workflow may take different paths, depending on&#xD;
        what happens during the interaction with the business actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The business use case can perform some subflows in optional sequences.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The business use case can perform several subflows at the same time.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You must describe all these optional or alternative subflows. It is recommended that each subflow be described in a&#xD;
    separate supplement to the workflow. In fact, this is mandatory for the following types of subflows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Subflows that occupy a large segment of a given workflow.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Exceptional subflows. Describing these helps the business use case's main workflow stand out more clearly.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Subflows that can be executed at several intervals in the same workflow.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If a subflow involves only a minor part of the complete workflow, describe it in the body of the text instead of in a&#xD;
    separate supplement.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can illustrate the structure of the workflow with a task diagram. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/activity_diagram_in_the_business_use-case_model_5862EB50.html&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Create use-case diagrams showing the business use case and its relationships to business actors and other business use&#xD;
    cases. A diagram of this type functions as a local diagram of the business use case and must be related to it. Note&#xD;
    that this kind of local use-case diagram typically is of little value, unless the business use case has extend- or&#xD;
    include-relationships that need to be explained, or if there is an unusual complexity among the business actors&#xD;
    involved. See also &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    A business use case is complete only when it describes everything the business performs. Before you finish, make sure&#xD;
    the business use case exhibits the characteristic properties of a good use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Evaluate each business use case and its workflow. A specific way to evaluate a business use-case workflow is to conduct&#xD;
    a walkthrough. In this method of evaluation, the person responsible for the business use case leads one or two members&#xD;
    of the project team through the business use-case workflow. Use a scenario: imagine a real-life situation with specific&#xD;
    people as actors when you walk through the business use case.&#xD;
