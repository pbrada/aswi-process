    Neither an exclusively top-down approach nor an exclusively bottom-up approach is sufficient for identifying business&#xD;
    goals. It is necessary to investigate and synchronize business goals from both perspectives. A combined approach such&#xD;
    as the one described here facilitates understanding and helps align the strategic, tactical, and operational levels of&#xD;
    the organization.&#xD;

    The purpose of this step is to determine the current and desired competitive positioning.&amp;nbsp; The business goals to&#xD;
    be defined in the next step will lead the organization to the desired situation. A number of techniques are applicable&#xD;
    here-for example, a Strengths, Weakness, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis or Porter's competitive analysis&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without a clear and well-communicated business strategy, realistic business goals cannot be set, and alignment between&#xD;
    business goals, processes, and strategy cannot be guaranteed.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once an enterprise has analyzed its mission and defined its goals, it needs a way to measure progress toward those&#xD;
    goals. Many things contribute to organization's success. Those that are key contributors such as Key Performance&#xD;
    Indicators (KPIs), also known as Key Success Indicators (KSIs) or Key Business Indicators (KBIs), are used by&#xD;
    businesses to define and measure progress toward their goals. In SOMA, KPIs represent quantifiable measurable&#xD;
    objectives, agreed to beforehand, that reflect the critical success factors of an organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote dir=&quot;ltr&quot; style=&quot;MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        &lt;em>KPIs differ depending on an industry and an organization. A sales organization may have as one of their KPIs&#xD;
        the percentage of its sales that comes from return customers. A Customer Service Organization may have a KPI that&#xD;
        measures a number of customer calls answered in under a minute. To determine if the objectives associated with a&#xD;
        KPI are being met, the KPI may need to be broken down into one or more metrics, which identify specific&#xD;
        measurements to collect for analysis (e.g. time to close an average sale deal).&lt;/em>&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this step is to define how the Business Goal will be measured by identifying &lt;em>at least&lt;/em>&amp;nbsp;one&#xD;
    KPI and hopefully the corresponding metrics for each goal and sub-goal. If you can find a quantitative measure to&#xD;
    assess whether or not the business goal has been achieved, the business goal probably can be related to business&#xD;
    activities. KPIs will provide the business with a measure of success of meeting its goals and sub-goals.&amp;nbsp; For&#xD;
    example, for a goal of &quot;increase revenue&quot;, a KPI could be &quot;increase revenue by 5% during the next fiscal year&quot; - this&#xD;
    provides a specific way to determine if the goal has been met. Metrics identify the type of measurements that need to&#xD;
    be collected to assess the state of the KPIs.&amp;nbsp; For a example KPI above, a metric could be &quot;record the revenue from&#xD;
    all revenue generating transactions&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to quantify the expected outcome and record this in the change value and change kind properties of the business&#xD;
    goal. Because people often set more ambitious goals for themselves than others would, it is useful to discuss the upper&#xD;
    and lower boundaries with those responsible for achieving the business goal. Employees need to feel that there is&#xD;
    enough challenge in their work, but they also like to be able to give themselves an occasional pat on the back.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As described in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_goal_CCCB68FF.html&quot; guid=&quot;9.06687347922131E-306&quot;>Guideline: Business&#xD;
    Goal&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;the relationship between Business Goals, KPIs and Metrics can be seen in the following diagram.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;img height=&quot;236&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/goal_kpi_metric.gif&quot; width=&quot;220&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the measure is qualitative or subjective, the business goal may need to be translated to more measurable, sub-goals.&#xD;
    In this case, the sub-goals are identified by considering how the higher-level goal will be measured. It is important&#xD;
    that all leaf-level goals have identified KPIs. Achievement of some or all of the sub-goals should result in&#xD;
    achievement of the higher-level goal. If a business goal has been assigned a date by which it should be achieved, it is&#xD;
    sufficiently concrete to be called an objective. When determining the timeframe within which the goal is to be&#xD;
    achieved, be ambitious yet realistic.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this step is to identify the relationships between higher level and lower level goals. This is the step&#xD;
    that will actually produce a hierarchy of business goals. Some business goals are not concrete and measurable enough to&#xD;
    allow you to find supporting business use cases. These are typically strategic goals that need to be defined at more&#xD;
    concrete levels.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business goals must be traced from higher level to lower level to produce a business-goal hierarchy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the daily operations of any enterprise, there are minor localized conflicts between scoring in the short-term and&#xD;
    building up long-term company value. A business-goal hierarchy derived from the Business Vision ensures that the right&#xD;
    tradeoffs are made between short-term financial goals and less immediate, yet more important, strategic goals.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this step is to verify that the business strategy has been successfully translated into a set of&#xD;
    management objectives for the organization. Review the business-goals hierarchy as well as the individual business&#xD;
    goals to ensure that they form a complete and consistent whole. Make sure that the business goals have been translated&#xD;
    to the business use cases so that the activities of the business are aligned with the desired competitive position of&#xD;
    the organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conduct a review session with management and stakeholders at different levels to ensure that the business goals support&#xD;
    the strategy and that business goals at different levels are unambiguous, measurable, and realistic. For help with&#xD;
