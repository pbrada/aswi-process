    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Define the Boundaries of the Target Organization&quot; name=&quot;Define the Boundaries of the Target Organization&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Discuss the boundaries of what you choose to include in your modeling effort. Decide what constitutes the target&#xD;
    organization. This can effectively (but not necessarily) be done using &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_actor_class_340D3EA2.html&quot; guid=&quot;_x8e2ANnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business&#xD;
    actor&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_use-case_class_8BABBBB1.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x9FS9tnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business use-case&lt;/a> notation, should the involved audience feel comfortable with such&#xD;
    notation. It is important to gain agreement on answers to the following questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What important parties in the environment do you consider external to the target organization? This means&#xD;
        identifying those parties whose work you cannot affect but with which you still need to have a well-defined&#xD;
        interface.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If you are performing business modeling in order to define the requirements for a particular system, are there any&#xD;
        parts of the organization that will &lt;i>not&lt;/i> be affected by this system? Those parts can be considered external,&#xD;
        since there is no point in using resources to produce descriptions of business processes that this project is not&#xD;
        influenced by or cannot influence.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The boundaries that you set for the target organization may be rather different from those that you consider to be the&#xD;
    boundaries of &quot;the company.&quot;&amp;nbsp;For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If your goal is to build a new sales support system, you might choose not to include anything that goes on in your&#xD;
        product development department. Nonetheless, the product development department must be considered a business&#xD;
        actor, since there are interfaces to it that need to be clarified. In this example, a party inside &quot;the company&quot; is&#xD;
        considered external to the target organization and is therefore modeled as a business actor.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the system you are building is supposed to enhance communication with partners or vendors (a&#xD;
        business-to-business application), you might choose to include those partners or vendors in your target&#xD;
        organization. In this case, a party that is external to &quot;the company&quot; is inside your target organization. Note that&#xD;
        this type of categorization is useful only if you have some insight into and influence on your partner's method of&#xD;
        operation. If you can influence only the interfaces to the partner, it should be considered external and be modeled&#xD;
        as a business actor.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the purpose of your project is to build a generic, customizable application (such as a commercial accounting&#xD;
        application), the target organization must represent your assumptions about how the customers who buy the end&#xD;
        product will use it. In this case, you are including an abstract party in the target organization.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Identify Stakeholders&quot; name=&quot;Identify Stakeholders&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholders are those groups (internal and external, individuals and organizations) that are entitled to influence the&#xD;
    outcome of the project or need to be kept informed of decisions made within it.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_target_organization_assessment_850E5BD3.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{1C96F563-092E-4584-A1C9-1A8CF58C7FA6}&quot;>Target-Organization Assessment&lt;/a>, you defined the stakeholders to the&#xD;
    business. In the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_vision_55FFBD95.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{C1A31211-2C05-4665-8DC5-6BFB63F4FCE4}&quot;>Business Vision&lt;/a>, you must specify which of these stakeholders are to&#xD;
    be considered within the boundaries of the project at hand. Your decisions in this regard will depend on the scope of&#xD;
    the business-modeling effort (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/scope_of_business_modeling_421E0509.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;7.910331746816979E-305&quot;>Concept: Scope of Business Modeling&lt;/a>), as well on as what boundaries you have defined&#xD;
    for the modeling effort.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Gain Agreement on the Goals of the Target Organization&quot;&#xD;
name=&quot;Gain Agreement on the Goals of the Target Organization&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to define the objectives of the business-modeling effort and manage stakeholders' expectations, clear&#xD;
    objectives must be set and agreed upon by involved parties. This helps keep the business-modeling team focused and&#xD;
    prevents divergent expectations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objectives set here are not the same as the business goals that are identified later. These objectives apply&#xD;
    specifically to what is to be achieved by the business-modeling effort. They are usually a combination of the following&#xD;
    aspirations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduce costs (operational and distribution). This is often a secondary objective, achieved by reducing lead time&#xD;
        and improving quality.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reduce lead-time. Improve responsiveness, shorten development cycles, improve productivity, and so on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Increase revenue.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Increase the number of customers.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Reach new markets.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve the quality of both products and services.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve inventory and procurement management.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Improve channel relationship (partners and vendors).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Increase customer satisfaction expressed in both objective and subjective terms.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Make your employees more effective in teaming and collaboration.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Merge businesses. When two businesses are combined into one, you might need to merge some of their business&#xD;
        processes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Outsource part of the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To help clarify objectives, it is useful to ask the stakeholders the following questions:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If we say this is impossible, what would you do then?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If we are successful, who will you tell about it?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If we are unsuccessful, who will you &lt;i>not&lt;/i> tell?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What will happen if we are unsuccessful?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Why do you think we are capable of solving this problem?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How will you determine whether we have solved your problem?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When will you consider the job done?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    You must consider a variety of sources of constraints. Here is a list of potential constraints and questions to ask&#xD;
    about them:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Political:&lt;/b> Are there internal or external political issues that affect potential solutions? Are there&#xD;
        interdepartmental issues?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Economic:&lt;/b> Which financial or budgetary constraints are applicable? Are there costs of goods sold or&#xD;
        product-pricing considerations? Are there any licensing issues? Are there signs that things are changing?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Organizational:&lt;/b> Are there any other initiatives currently underway that may be affected? Is the organization&#xD;
        changing? Do the involved parties know the history of the problem?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Environmental:&lt;/b> Are there environmental or regulatory constraints or legal issues? Are there other standards&#xD;
        that might restrict us?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Technical:&lt;/b> Are we restricted in our choice of technologies? Are we constrained to work within existing&#xD;
        platforms or technologies? Are we prohibited from using any new ones?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Feasibility:&lt;/b> Is the schedule defined? Are we restricted to using existing resources? Can we use outside&#xD;
        labor? Can we expand resources? If so, can we do so on a temporary or a permanent basis?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>System:&lt;/b> Is the solution to be built on our existing systems? Must we maintain compatibility with existing&#xD;
        solutions? Which operating systems and environments must be supported?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_NZDf5NnnEdmO6L4XMImrsA" name=" Formulate Problem Statement " guid="_NZDf5NnnEdmO6L4XMImrsA">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Formulate Problem Statement&quot; name=&quot;Formulate Problem Statement&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Most business-modeling efforts imply some change, and that change must be well motivated. You must formulate and&#xD;
    document a problem statement in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_vision_55FFBD95.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{C1A31211-2C05-4665-8DC5-6BFB63F4FCE4}&quot;>Business Vision&lt;/a>. This document, and the problem statement in&#xD;
    particular, serve to convince stakeholders of the need for change and focus all involved parties on the issues that&#xD;
    must be addressed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In your &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_target_organization_assessment_850E5BD3.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{1C96F563-092E-4584-A1C9-1A8CF58C7FA6}&quot;>Target-Organization Assessment&lt;/a>, you might have defined a list of&#xD;
    problems that the stakeholders have determined exist in the target organization. In the Business Vision, you need to&#xD;
    limit the list of problems to the ones you intend to focus on solving within the boundaries of your business-modeling&#xD;
    effort. While it is very difficult to identify one single root cause for all the problems you have found, you must&#xD;
    always attempt to do this. Formulating a problem statement helps determine whether the perceived problem is in fact the&#xD;
    real problem.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Working with the whole team, use easel charts to fill in the following template for each problem you have identified:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>The problem of&lt;/b> (Describe the problem.)&lt;br />&#xD;
     &lt;b>affects&lt;/b> (List the stakeholders affected by the problem.)&lt;br />&#xD;
     &lt;b>the impact of which is&lt;/b> (Describe the impact of the problem.)&lt;br />&#xD;
     &lt;b>A successful solution would&lt;/b> (List some key benefits of a successful solution.)&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this template is to help you distinguish solutions and answers from problems and questions. For example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;b>The problem of&lt;/b> untimely and improper resolution of customer service issues&lt;br />&#xD;
     &lt;b>affects&lt;/b> our customers, customer support reps, and service technicians&lt;br />&#xD;
     &lt;b>the impact of which is&lt;/b> customer dissatisfaction, perceived lack of quality, unhappy employees, and loss of&#xD;
    revenue.&lt;b>&lt;br />&#xD;
     A successful solution would&lt;/b> provide real-time access to a troubleshooting database by support reps and facilitate&#xD;
    the timely dispatch of service technicians to only those locations that genuinely need their assistance.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Determine What Areas to Prioritize&quot; name=&quot;Determine What Areas to Prioritize&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You must discuss and agree upon what areas of the target organization your business-modeling effort should prioritize.&#xD;
    This discussion may take slightly different paths, depending on the scope of your business-modeling effort.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If you are modeling to create a chart or to make simple improvements, you must look at your descriptions of the&#xD;
        current business (its business actors and business use cases) and walk through the workflows step by step to&#xD;
        determine areas that need improvement. See the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_vision_9CCFE25D.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.0845709780548712E-305&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
        Business Vision&lt;/a>, the section on Finding Areas for Improvement.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the purpose of your modeling is to create a new business or to radically change an existing one, you must focus&#xD;
        on a larger scope. You can start by questioning the boundaries of your business. See the &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_vision_9CCFE25D.html&quot;&#xD;

        The names and outlines of the target organization's new or radically changed business use cases.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An overview and high-level description of the future business use cases, emphasizing how they differ from current&#xD;
        ones. For each business use case, the document must name the customer, supplier, or other type of partner. In&#xD;
        addition, it must describe the input, tasks, and product. These descriptions must present the philosophy and&#xD;
        objectives of the business in straightforward and objective terms. However, they do not need to be comprehensive or&#xD;
        detailed. They are intended to stimulate discussion among senior executives, employees, customers, and partners.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measurable properties and goals for each business use case, such as cost, quality, lifecycle, lead time, and&#xD;
        customer satisfaction. Each goal should be traceable to the business strategy, and its description must indicate&#xD;
        how it supports that strategy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Specifications of the technologies that will support the business use cases, with special emphasis on technology&#xD;
        support.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A description of imaginable future scenarios. As far as possible, the specification should predict how the business&#xD;
        use cases will have to change in the next few years due to new technologies, new interfaces to the environment, and&#xD;
        other types of resources.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        A list of critical success factors; that is, factors that are critical to the successful implementation of the&#xD;
