    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business architecture overview is created early in the lifecycle of a project, possibly as early as the development&#xD;
    of the proposal. It is often depicted in graphical form, using some informal notation or storyboarding technique. It&#xD;
    represents the intent and idea behind a business modeling effort. The lead business-process analyst produces the&#xD;
    business architecture overview, often in collaboration with the project sponsor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The overview graph must indicate major elements of the business and its environment, such as teams, business tools, and&#xD;
    external sources of influence (for example, regulatory bodies, partners, and market segments).&amp;nbsp;The overview graph&#xD;
    most often does not focus on the entire business architecture as described here. However, a large effort, such as a&#xD;
    business process re-engineering (BPR) project, would consider the entire business architecture. The notion of business&#xD;
    architecture is described in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/business_architecture_D437B035.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.6275891002471178E-306&quot;>Concept:&#xD;
    Business Architecture&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is useful to consider the purpose of business architecture and its intended audience. This ensures that the manner&#xD;
    in which the business architecture is described and presented will be appropriate for those who must understand it. The&#xD;
    intended audience can be categorized into different groups with various concerns. Each of these groups will be&#xD;
    interested in different architectural views of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_architecture_document_A73E67D4.html&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At this point, the business architecture overview is a provisional first pass. No commitments should be based on this&#xD;
    overview diagram. The initial overview graph may or may not be included as part of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_architecture_document_A73E67D4.html&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify the constraints and trends within the business and its environment that could have a significant effect on the&#xD;
    structure of the business or the way in which it works. When defining the business architecture, these forces must be&#xD;
    analyzed to ensure that the business can adapt to possible changes within a reasonable time and withstand other kinds&#xD;
    of impact.&amp;nbsp; Forces that are worth considering include the business strategy and trends, as well as possible future&#xD;
    events that would affect every part of the organization or radically change some significant central part of it. In&#xD;
    addition, it is important to consider changes that might have to be made very rapidly, along with constraints that&#xD;
    might be imposed or lifted in future that may alter the way business is done or open new opportunities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Consider the probability of these events or changes occurring, and try to visualize their effects on the business. Once&#xD;
    you understand the probabilities and effects, you can prioritize these forces and make decisions regarding how to deal&#xD;
    with the highest-priority issues. The options available for dealing with each change are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prepare for rapid response to the change.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Act is if the change has already occurred.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify and briefly describe business systems within the business being modeled. Business systems are really only&#xD;
    useful for large, complex business models. Depending on the business-modeling scenario and the scope of your efforts,&#xD;
    you might decide against using business systems at all.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business system represents a relatively independent capability within the organization. It defines a set of&#xD;
    responsibilities as well as the business workers, business entities, and business events that undertake these&#xD;
    responsibilities. In this way, a business system is a structural part of the organization, like a department, except&#xD;
    that the only interactions allowed within a business system are through the predefined responsibilities. Consider, for&#xD;
    example, a serving window in a restaurant or an IT support department with a services catalog. In both these examples,&#xD;
    there are predefined interactions. What, for example, would happen if you went around to the back of the restaurant to&#xD;
    try to get a meal from somebody in the kitchen? Similarly, what would happen if you asked the computer support&#xD;
    technician to book you an airline flight? We use business systems to disallow any interactions with the business&#xD;
    workers and business entities within it, other than the specified interactions. This allows us to partition large,&#xD;
    complex business models so that we can focus on detailing one part of the model without losing sight of where it fits&#xD;
    into the whole.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Discuss and obtain agreement regarding which (if any) business systems should be included in your model. Some business&#xD;
    systems may be described in only limited detail in the context of the business use-case realizations. Others may&#xD;
    provide important input or receive output, in which cases they should be modeled as business actors. This means they&#xD;
    are external to the business being modeled.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may want to indicate how a business system participates in a business use case without showing the internal&#xD;
    interactions between business workers and business entities within that business system. Where necessary, you can &quot;zoom&#xD;
    into&quot; the business system to show internal collaborations as part of the business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This view describes the geographic locations in which the business is deployed, along with the distribution of&#xD;
    organizational structure and function across these locations. The locality view is useful for assessing the impact of&#xD;
    time and distance on the business processes. Processes may be streamlined, or the organization itself may be&#xD;
    restructured to eliminate the overhead of coordinating distributed tasks.&amp;nbsp; Furthermore, unique characteristics of&#xD;
    each location (such as legislation, resources, accessibility, or image) may affect the decision to deploy certain&#xD;
    business activities there. Ships may also be regarded as locations. The process of defining the Geographic View&#xD;
    consists of the following tasks:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the major locations (countries or cities) in which business activities are performed.&#xD;

        Identify the dependencies and paths of communication between these locations.&#xD;

        Map the business systems (from the Organization View) to these locations.&#xD;

    The process of defining the human resource aspects of the business includes the following tasks:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consider the competence profiles that exist within the organization. Define competence profiles that will be&#xD;
        required in the future, or define the necessary changes to the existing profiles. Will the future business require&#xD;
        employees to be more or less independent? Will they need higher or lower education requirements?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Discuss education needs. Define both long-term training programs to overcome the differences between current and&#xD;
        desired competence profiles, as well as any initial training needs associated with the introduction of new business&#xD;
        processes.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define any mechanisms (reward structures, trainee programs, mentor programs, or other incentives) that exist or&#xD;
        need to be put in place to enhance skill levels. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Explore the possibility of relocating individuals in the organization due to changes in responsibilities or the&#xD;
        need to enhance communication.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process of describing cultural aspects of the business includes the following tasks:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine the characteristics of the culture.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine which of these characteristics are key to the organization and must be left undisturbed.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Discuss which characteristics must change.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Determine what mechanisms are in place to maintain and encourage the culture. Discuss ideas for new or changed&#xD;
        mechanisms.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define a path to be taken to introduce any changes that you deem necessary.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
