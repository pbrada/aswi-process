    guid=&quot;_jMFtgBpVEdqUwb9RAn2tTA&quot;>Task: Business Operation Analysis&lt;/a>, the Business Designer created subsystem&#xD;
    interactions (without much detail) in the Business Analysis Model. &lt;b>Recall that you had organized the granularity of&#xD;
    these interactions so that they were grouped by Business System Operation, that is, you captured the interactions that&#xD;
    realize each Business System Operation&lt;/b>. Now, working with the expanded (white-box)&amp;nbsp;business use-case&#xD;
    descriptions, the detail of messages, entities exchanged, sequencing, control flow, and associated data is added and&#xD;
    the resulting Operation Realizations are captured in the Business Design Model, again organized by Business System&#xD;
    Operation. As this detail is added, the Business Designer evaluates the quality of the emergent collaborations, looking&#xD;
    for opportunities to refactor the design. Annotate the Operation Realizations with descriptions of what the subsystem&#xD;
    does when processing a message (drawn from the white-box step description and refined if necessary). These descriptions&#xD;
    help with the next step, to develop specifications for each &lt;i>Sub&lt;/i>system Operation.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Designer produced the initial Subsystem Operation Survey placeholder during the Operation Analysis task.&#xD;
    Next, working from the white-box steps and the Operation Realizations, the Subsystem Operations are identified and&#xD;
    their behavior specified. As with the identification of business system operations, there &lt;i>might not&lt;/i> be a unique&#xD;
    subsystem operation for each white-box step; that is, as you examine the set of white-box steps and their associated&#xD;
    exchange of messages, input-output entities, and so forth., you might find that it is possible to define a smaller set&#xD;
    of Subsystem Operations to fulfill their needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The operations&amp;nbsp;can also be resorted by locality or by process, thus showing the association of a set of Subsystem&#xD;
    Operations with each locality or with each process. The locality sort gives an indication of the load at a locality&#xD;
    (and so is useful for reasoning about the capacity of the components that support the locality). In this form, the&#xD;
    survey sorted by locality becomes a property of the Business Deployment Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a Subsystem Operation is hosted at multiple localities, this indicates that at least part of the subsystem is&#xD;
    replicated. There is no implication that these replicated portions &lt;i>necessarily&lt;/i> share data or are kept in&#xD;
    synchronization. These are design choices which depend on the application and reason for replication; for example, the&#xD;
    processing required might be identical, but occur for a different business segment. In the extreme, all of a&#xD;
    subsystem's operations can be hosted at multiple localities, meaning that, effectively, the subsystem itself is&#xD;
    replicated. The need to identify replicated instances uniquely also depends on the reasons for replication.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process sort allows the Business Designer to reason about concurrency issues: if you were to view a Subsystem&#xD;
    Operation as a discrete piece of functionality available to business actors, then, as a first approximation, operations&#xD;
    associated with the same process cannot be performed in parallel. This might lead the Business Designer to reconsider&#xD;
    the process allocation, or consider process replication, or to examine the perceived latency problem at a lower level&#xD;
    of detail, for example, through examination of time-slicing options, and process sharing when an operation blocks (to&#xD;
    do input-output, for example). These techniques can give acceptable responsiveness, whereas a delaying of the start of&#xD;
    an operation (strictly serializing operations) might be intolerable. In this form, the survey sorted by process becomes&#xD;
    a property of the Business Design Model.&#xD;

    For each subsystem, you have:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        defined its operations&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        defined the interfaces you expect the subsystem to support&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        described how the subsystem collaborates with other subsystems to realize the business use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        defined the subsystem's context: its actors, interfaces and I/O business entities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You are thus well positioned to be able to hand-off this set of work products for or to perform further decomposition&#xD;
    in a recursive fashion.&#xD;
