  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The System Designer role defines the details of interactions between the subsystems that are initially defined by the&#xD;
    System Architect, to deliver the desired behavior specified in the System Use-Case Model. In doing so, the System&#xD;
    Designer might make changes to the subsystem structure, which are subsequently validated by the System Architect.&#xD;
    Having established the responsibilities and operations required of each subsystem, the System Designer aggregates these&#xD;
    and abstracts them back to a specification of required behavior for each subsystem, in a Subsystem Use-Case Model.&#xD;
    Concurrently, the non-functional requirements and constraints are flowed down to the subsystems by the System Designer,&#xD;
    in the Subsystem Supplementary Requirements. Thus, while designer at the system level, the System Designer becomes the&#xD;
    Requirements Specifier for the next level.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
  <skills>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The performance of the System Designer role requires skills that bridge design and requirements specification,&#xD;
    accordingly the System Designer, like the System Architect, must have strong skills in analysis and synthesis. The&#xD;
    System Designer engages in detailed modeling, and so must have a good grounding in UML. Required to work from system&#xD;
    requirements, and empowered to do subsystem refactoring if required, the system designer needs good domain knowledge,&#xD;
    and also good knowledge of the likely target technologies for the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The System Designer also brings systems engineering skills to bear in the synthesis and comparison of various design&#xD;
    choices and the determination of how well they meet non-functional requirements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The System Designer and System Architect must work in a complementary way, with the System Designer actively supporting&#xD;
    the realization of the System Architect's vision, so the communication between these roles must be effective.&#xD;
&lt;/p></skills>
  <assignmentApproaches>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A larger project might have a team performing the System Designer role; one way to divide the work is to distribute&#xD;
    responsibility for subsystems throughout the team, although this can require high-bandwidth communication (in joint&#xD;
    design sessions) within the team while the subsystem interactions are being detailed.&#xD;
&lt;/p></assignmentApproaches>
