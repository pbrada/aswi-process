    (1) From Nielsen Norman Group (http://www.nngroup.com/about/userexperience.html): &quot;User experience&quot; encompasses all&#xD;
    aspects of the end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products. The first requirement for an&#xD;
    exemplary user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and&#xD;
    elegance that produce products that are a joy to own, a joy to use. True user experience goes far beyond giving&#xD;
    customers what they say they want, or providing checklist features. In order to achieve high-quality user experience in&#xD;
    a company's offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple disciplines, including engineering,&#xD;
    marketing, graphical and industrial design, and interface design.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    (2) User experience is about usability, which has a broader scope than &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/user_interface_7C5954EE.html&quot; guid=&quot;_ybLkPNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>user&#xD;
    interface&lt;/a>. It includes the application's look-and-feel; not just what the user-interface provides from a functional&#xD;
    point-of-view. However, there is a component of user experience that is concerned with UI.&#xD;
