  <mainDescription>&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Purpose&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purposes of business modeling are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To understand current problems in the target organization and identify improvement potentials.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To assess the impact of organizational change.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To ensure that customers, users, developers, and other parties have a common understanding of the organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To derive the software system requirements needed to support the target organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To understand how a to-be-deployed software system fits into the organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An organizational chart is not enough to understand how a business works. We also need a dynamic view of the business.&#xD;
    A business model provides a static view of the structure of the organization and a dynamic view of the processes within&#xD;
    the organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business needs to change according to the factors that drive it and keep it healthy. These factors might be goals&#xD;
    such as reducing costs, improving quality, or shortening time-to-market. We need to model the business to localize&#xD;
    problems or identify opportunities for improvements. A characteristic of a healthy-and-learning organization is that it&#xD;
    is able to adapt as its business drivers change.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Many different people (stakeholders) need to understand the business. Because all of these people have different&#xD;
    backgrounds and interests, they have different views of the business. We need to model the business in a simple,&#xD;
    understandable way, using a common notation. The business model must support the ability to be described in different&#xD;
    ways using different views and levels of abstraction. If everybody cannot understand your business model, you are&#xD;
    missing the point of modeling the business!&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business is about delivering value to customers to make a profit. Running a business is about making decisions, and&#xD;
    information is the most important determinant in the quality of decisions [MARS00]. Information systems must be&#xD;
    designed to ensure that the information provided is timely, accurate, sufficient, and relevant. We can ensure that&#xD;
    information systems support business decisions in this way only if we understand the context in which those decisions&#xD;
    are made.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Artifacts&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To achieve these goals, the business-modeling discipline describes how to assess the current organization and develop a&#xD;
    vision of the new organization. Using this vision as a basis, it then defines the processes, roles, and&#xD;
    responsibilities of that organization in a business use-case model and a business-analysis model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Complementary to these models, the following artifacts are developed:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business Vision&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business Architecture Document&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Supplementary Business Specification&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business Rules (either as a document and/or as elements in the Business Analysis Model)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business Glossary&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Process and Notation&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;span lang=&quot;NL&quot;>There are many available business-modeling techniques and notations that have been used with varying&#xD;
    degrees of success.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span> However, there are fewer business-modeling&#xD;
    processes.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span>The RUP provides a process for business modeling.&lt;span&#xD;
    style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;>&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span> The Unified Modeling Language (UML) can be effectively applied to modeling both&#xD;
    software and a business. The single most important advantage in using the same modeling notation for both business and&#xD;
    software modeling, is that business analysts and software developers share a common language. This allows a direct and&#xD;
    efficient translation between models of the business and models of the software systems that support that&#xD;
    business.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Modeling, understanding, and improving a business is very much like building a software system. There is a journey of&#xD;
    discovery in the beginning that includes defining the objectives and scope. This journey also involves making a broad&#xD;
    high-level outline and filling it in piece by piece. We cannot focus on one piece, finish it, and never look at it&#xD;
    again. Very often we must revisit pieces that we already have modeled and change them based on new insights and&#xD;
    understanding. We cannot wait until we have completely finished modeling the entire business before we start verifying&#xD;
    our work and making improvements.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business modeling is therefore best done in an iterative fashion, starting with the broad overview and filling it in&#xD;
    piece by piece. In every iteration, we revisit the broad overview and make any necessary adjustments. We then fill out&#xD;
    more of the overview and verify the work that we have done. These steps must be completed before starting the next&#xD;
    iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Relation to Other Disciplines&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business-modeling discipline is related to other disciplines, as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;b>Requirements&lt;/b> discipline uses business models as an important input to understanding the requirements of&#xD;
        the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;b>Analysis and Design&lt;/b> discipline uses business models as an input to defining software systems that&#xD;
        seamlessly fit into the organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;b>Deployment&lt;/b> discipline uses business models as an aid in planning the deployment of a software system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The &lt;b>Environment&lt;/b> discipline develops and maintains supporting artifacts, such as the Business Modeling&#xD;
        Guidelines.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
