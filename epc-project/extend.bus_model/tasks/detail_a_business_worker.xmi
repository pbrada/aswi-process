&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make sure you have access to descriptions of all workflows in which the business worker participates. Also, you may&#xD;
    need descriptions of the business workers with which this business worker communicates, as well as business entities&#xD;
    accessed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Decide the business worker's areas of responsibilities within each business use-case realization. Briefly describe each&#xD;
    responsibility in the business worker's responsibility section.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Write step-by-step instructions for each operation that describe what the person acting as the business worker must do.&#xD;
    These detailed work instructions could be used either as guidelines or as a prescriptive recipe for performing the&#xD;
    work. The choice depends on the culture and type of business.&amp;nbsp; Highly skilled and motivated knowledge workers&#xD;
    prefer ad-hoc work processes so that they have the freedom to optimally perform the process for a particular situation.&#xD;
    However, environments in which there are potentially disastrous consequences (such as an operator in a nuclear plant)&#xD;
    require strictly drilled routines and procedures. It may also be necessary to prescribe work processes for&#xD;
    under-skilled or unmotivated staff in order to guarantee minimum performance of business use cases.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Define Operations&quot; name=&quot;Define Operations&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On the basis of what the business worker does in each business use-case realization, decide what operations the&#xD;
    business worker should perform. A business worker can have one or more operations for each area of responsibility.&#xD;
    Briefly describe each operation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Finalize the responsibility description and explain how all operations are related, including the business worker's&#xD;
    lifecycle. Also, describe how the business worker should prioritize among the operations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Define Attributes&quot; name=&quot;Define Attributes&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify and describe the attributes of the business worker based on the business worker's operations. These attributes&#xD;
    consist of the information that the business worker requires or manages while performing its responsibilities.&#xD;
    Attributes must not be the same as the business entities with which the business worker interacts.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Describe Competence Requirements&quot; name=&quot;Describe Competence Requirements&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Describe the levels of competence that are required of the business worker (or the collection of people acting as the&#xD;
    business worker). Competence requirements are described as skill types and indicate the required (or desired) levels of&#xD;
    proficiency for performing the business worker's responsibilities effectively. These skill types can be compared with&#xD;
    the actual available competencies to determine the effect on the performance of business use cases. This comparison is&#xD;
    also important to consider when improving or redesigning business use cases. Is the difference between available and&#xD;
    desired competencies realistic?&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Analyze Relationships&quot; name=&quot;Analyze Relationships&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Review the relationships (association, dependency, generalization) that the business worker has with other business&#xD;
    workers, business entities, and business events. Determine whether the relationships are described properly and whether&#xD;
    they are all really necessary to the performance of the business worker's responsibilities. Also confirm that the&#xD;
    business worker does indeed have all the required relationships necessary to perform its responsibilities.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

    Review and discuss the business worker with other members of the team and appropriate stakeholders. Make sure that they&#xD;
    have a clear understanding of the business worker and agree on its description.&#xD;
