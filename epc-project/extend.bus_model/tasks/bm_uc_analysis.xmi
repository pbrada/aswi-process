    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each role (human or system) in the organization, identify a business worker and give it a brief description.&#xD;
    Employment positions are a good place to start, but be aware that a person in a specific position is usually required&#xD;
    to fulfill more than one role and that various roles are often filled by people in different positions. You can also&#xD;
    look at the software systems currently being used. However, you must be aware that-like people-many software systems&#xD;
    perform multiple roles within the organization. This integration of sometimes completely different roles is one of the&#xD;
    factors that makes software maintenance so difficult and locks a business in to a system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After you have identified your business workers, walk through each business use case and state which business workers&#xD;
    are involved in which steps. This ensures that no business workers have been missed and that the ones that you have&#xD;
    listed are all &quot;inside&quot; the part of the business you are modeling.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For more information on business workers, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_worker_A7C3AF61.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.0515380886761288E-306&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_lE8TEB8XEdqrYeJuOWf-Yg" name="Identify Business Entities" guid="_lE8TEB8XEdqrYeJuOWf-Yg">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    To find candidate business entities, consider what information each business worker handles. The information that must&#xD;
    be queried, validated, created, or communicated is a good starting point. Only significant, persistent information&#xD;
    should be considered as a business entity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To show how business entities need to &quot;know about&quot; one another, use associations (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/association_in_the_business_analysis_model_BB06CDDA.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;3.692812179186766E-305&quot;>Guideline: Association in the Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>). Give the associations role&#xD;
    names for clarification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If business entities have clear whole-part relationships, show that fact with aggregation-relationships (see &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/aggregation_in_the_business_analysis_model_486F84A9.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;5.888288202551755E-305&quot;>Guideline: Aggregation in the Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If business entities are specializations or generalizations of one another, use generalization-relationships to show&#xD;
    this (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/generalization_in_the_business_analysis_model_C74DAF63.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;1.410487898839562E-305&quot;>Guideline: Generalization in the Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>). It is often wise to wait&#xD;
    to establish generalizations until after you have worked on describing the business entities (see &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/tasks/detail_a_business_entity_11E120FA.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{06A9A8AA-171C-4A9C-8CD8-A366F32AA77F}&quot;>Task: Detail a Business Entity&lt;/a>).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Document the relationships in class diagrams (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/diagrams_in_the_business_analysis_model_F0F7B759.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;2.967860873569252E-305&quot;>Guideline: Diagrams in the Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;- Class Diagrams section).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Walk through the workflow of each business use case to ensure that no business entities have been forgotten. Also, make&#xD;
    sure that the ones you have identified are actually participating in a workflow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For more information on business entities, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Inspect the interactions between business actors, business workers, and business entities. Business actors may initiate&#xD;
    a business use case by sending a business event. Business workers may send business events to business actors or to&#xD;
    each other. If a message between two business workers has one of the following characteristics, it might be a business&#xD;
    event:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The sender of the message does not need to wait for the receiver to process the message.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There is a significant lapse of time between when the message is sent and when it is received.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There is a significant physical distance between sender and receiver.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The receiver is in another business system. In this case, the business event must be sent to the business system&#xD;
        and not directly to the business worker within it.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business events may also be used to send signals between business systems and business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For more information on business events, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;DEFINE Business Use Case Realizations?&quot; name=&quot;Define Business Use Case Realizations&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each business use case, create a Business Use-Case Realization in the Business Analysis Model. The name of the&#xD;
    Business Use-case Realization must be the same as the associated business use case. Furthermore, a&#xD;
    realization-relationship should be established from the business use case realization to its associated business use&#xD;
    case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify which business workers and business entities participate in the execution of each business use case. They form&#xD;
    the business use-case realization of the business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Present the business workers and business entities of the business use-case realization in a sequence diagram (see &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementlinkwithtype&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/diagrams_in_the_business_analysis_model_F0F7B759.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;2.967860873569252E-305&quot;>Guideline: Diagrams in the Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;- Sequence Diagrams section).&#xD;
    Show only those interactions that are necessary an understanding of how the business workers and entities perform this&#xD;
    business use-case realization workflow. There should be at least one interaction (sequence diagram) for every flow&#xD;
    described in the business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Instead of using a sequence diagram, you can present the participating business workers and business entities in a&#xD;
    communication diagram (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithtype&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/diagrams_in_the_business_analysis_model_F0F7B759.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;2.967860873569252E-305&quot;>Guideline: Diagrams in the Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>). Sequence diagrams are superior&#xD;
    for large and complex interactions, while communication diagrams provide a better overview of relationships between&#xD;
    participants.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To clarify the meaning of the communication diagrams, you can describe the workflow of each business use-case&#xD;
    realization in terms of its elements-the interacting business workers handling business entities. This is optional, and&#xD;
    it only adds value for more complex workflows or parts of workflows. To perform this task:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe the normal workflow of the business use-case realization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe any alternative and optional workflows.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Define performance goals in terms of cost and lead times for business workers and business entities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Analyze the lifecycle of each business entity. Each one should be created and removed by someone during the life of a&#xD;
    business. Make sure that each business entity is accessed and used by a business worker or another business entity. Do&#xD;
    this by creating a matrix or generating a report showing which business workers create and use the business entities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reduce the number of workers. As you develop your models, it is likely that you will find one or more too many workers&#xD;
    per use-case realization. Make sure that each business worker corresponds to a set of tasks that one person typically&#xD;
    would do, even though those tasks are divided among more than one business use case. You can do this by deriving and&#xD;
    examining the responsibilities required of the business worker from all business use-case realizations in which the&#xD;
    business worker participates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each business entity should have an owner-that is, someone who is responsible for it. You can model this with an&#xD;
    association from the business worker to the business entities for which the business worker is responsible. Some&#xD;
    business entities might be owned by people outside the business. If that is the case, make sure that it is mentioned in&#xD;
    the brief description of the business entity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For very large or complex business models, you can use &lt;a class=&quot;elementlinkwithtype&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;{4064F184-314B-4965-9F08-6AE5DBF6205A}&quot;>Artifact: Business System&lt;/a> for structuring and partitioning. In this&#xD;
    case, you can assign business workers, business entities, and business events to a business system. Make sure that the&#xD;
    relationships and responsibilities defined by the business systems support the interactions between the business&#xD;
    workers, entities, and events. If necessary, the business systems must be slightly adjusted (in consultation with the&#xD;
    business process analyst), or the interactions must be refined.&#xD;
