    Functional area analysis can begin with a component business model (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/business_component_modeling_527F8FC0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_uKecsC7xEdu14aFGpEDchg&quot;>Concept: Component Business Modeling&lt;/a>) and use the identified &lt;em>CBM&#xD;
    competencies&lt;/em> as a starting point for the set of &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_domain_FAAADFBF.html&quot; guid=&quot;__IIS0ExMEduGSMz-5zscXg&quot;>Artifact: Business&#xD;
    Domain&lt;/a>s. The business modeling effort is scoped by the business domain(s) under study, so functional area analysis&#xD;
    may select from the initial set of business domains and further decompose these into sub-domains, and ultimately into&#xD;
    functional areas -- &lt;em>CBM components&lt;/em> from the initial model should give good guidance here.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Functional area analysis begins by creating summary descriptions that identify the major high level functional&#xD;
    responsibilities of each domain.&amp;nbsp; Next, each domain is decomposed into smaller, more discrete, functional areas.&#xD;
    Each functional area is described in terms of the specific functions it is responsible for, as well as functions it&#xD;
    depends on during collaborations with other functional areas. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    Functional Area Analysis&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If functional area analysis is being carried out using input from a CBM effort,&amp;nbsp;a business domain will typically&#xD;
    map to a CBM competency, CBM business components are a good starting point for the identification of functional areas,&#xD;
    and CBM component services and activities are a good way to identify functions.&amp;nbsp; CBM components often&#xD;
    map&amp;nbsp;one-to-one to functional areas, although in some cases a CBM component may be too coarse grained, encompassing&#xD;
    too many types of functions. In that case it would need to be further decomposed into multiple functional areas.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The functional areas will be assigned to &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    these functions - the functions themselves may also suggest automation -- the IT subsystems within the Business Systems&#xD;
    that will realize some or all of the services.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    As each functional area is being analyzed and described in terms of its functions, it is also analyzed in the larger&#xD;
    context of its relationships to other functional areas (that is, the interactions and collaborations among functional&#xD;
    areas) are identified.&amp;nbsp; This will help determine how the Business Systems owning the functional areas will&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The partitioning of the business domain results in a set of functional areas.&amp;nbsp; These functional areas&amp;nbsp;should&#xD;
    suggest aggregates of cohesive functionality that can be assigned to subsystems, which will deliver that&#xD;
    capability.&amp;nbsp; Each subsystem is a conceptual mechanism to help define the encapsulation of services to deliver that&#xD;
    capability -- and which may ultimately be automated by IT systems within the Business System. Subsystems collaborate to&#xD;
    deliver the services provided by the Business System that owns the functional area.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The identification of subsystems as a result of functional area analysis allows the seamless transition from business&#xD;
    identification of functional areas,&amp;nbsp;their mapping to Business Systems&amp;nbsp;to the determination of which&#xD;
    subsystems are actually involved in the implementation of a given functional area.&amp;nbsp;The subsystems become a&#xD;
    blueprint for reuse.&amp;nbsp;This approach provides us not only with an abstract&amp;nbsp;specification of behavior&amp;nbsp;of a&#xD;
    subsystem, but also contracts by which subsystems collaborate and depend upon one another.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It may not be necessary to further refine the functionality assigned to a Business System, in which case there is a&#xD;
    one-to-one mapping between the functional area and a subsystem, that is the Business System supporting the functional&#xD;
    area has a single IT subsystem analog which yields its behavior. A proliferation of subsystems, on the other hand, may&#xD;
    be an indication that the functional area is too coarse-grained to be assigned to a single Business System, and needs&#xD;
    to be further divided.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note, additional details on Subsystem Identification are available in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of functional area analysis is to validate initial ideas about the partitioning of the business, firstly&#xD;
    into business domains (which will logically enclose a set of business systems that are of interest for the business&#xD;
    modeling effort) -- noting that this may require an intermediate step of identifying sub-domains to delineate the part&#xD;
    of the business to be studied -- and then by discovering functional areas, that is, aggregates of functionality that&#xD;
    can be assigned to &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_system_BB28EEB.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{4064F184-314B-4965-9F08-6AE5DBF6205A}&quot;>&lt;em>business systems&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. It is a complementary approach to &lt;a&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_xfhhcBpWEdqUwb9RAn2tTA&quot;>&lt;em>Business Architectural Analysis&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and can be used in concert with that task.&#xD;
