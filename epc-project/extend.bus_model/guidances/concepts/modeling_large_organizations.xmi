&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The differences between a small and a large organization lie in the broader spectrum of products, often within several&#xD;
    totally different product families. Generally the higher the complexity of products, the more distributed the&#xD;
    organization and the market. This results in a larger number of more complex business use cases, involving many more&#xD;
    employees with more specialized tasks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The techniques proposed here can be applied independently or in combination.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;High-Level and Detailed Business Use Cases&quot; name=&quot;High-Level and Detailed Business Use Cases&quot;>High-Level and&#xD;
    Detailed Business Use Cases&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A company's executive management, as well as its process owners, are interested in their company's business models-the&#xD;
    management must work with the company's strategic objectives, whereas the process owners and leaders need a detailed&#xD;
    picture of how their process should be performed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the differences between the executives' and the process owners' views of the organization are too great, you could&#xD;
    satisfy their needs by developing two different, yet related, sets of business use cases. One model, for the&#xD;
    executives, would contain a set of high-level business use cases that showed the intent and purpose of the&#xD;
    organization. The other model, for the process owners, would contain a detailed set of use cases that helped clarify&#xD;
    how the organization needs to function internally. For each high-level business use case, you could define one, or&#xD;
    several, detailed business use cases representing the same activities in the organization. For example, you could start&#xD;
    with the primary business actor, detail the results and services he or she is interested in, or even specialize the&#xD;
    business actor itself, then develop a separate business use case for each detailed area.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you want to engineer your organization one business use case at a time, you can apply this technique incrementally.&#xD;
    First make a high-level use-case model of the entire business and rank the business use cases in an overview, then&#xD;
    identify one or several detailed business use cases for the highest ranked, high-level business use cases.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is a one-to-one relationship between a high-level business use case and its set of detailed business use cases.&#xD;
    The relationships between business use cases of the two categories are represented as &amp;lt;&amp;lt;refinement&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&#xD;
    relationships, a stereotype of dependency. A high-level business use case, and the group of detailed business use cases&#xD;
    it represents, can be presented in the same diagram.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    High-level business use cases and detailed business use cases. The detailed business use cases have been identified by&#xD;
    detailing the results in which the customer and potential customer are interested.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Super-Ordinate and Subordinate Models&quot; name=&quot;Super-Ordinate and Subordinate Models&quot;>Superordinate and&#xD;
    Subordinate Models&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The technique for modeling business use cases presented so far is most easily applied to companies that have a single&#xD;
    business area and whose business activities are concentrated geographically at one location. For larger companies&#xD;
    distributed over several locations, it may be necessary to scale up the technique.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore, to model companies built of independent-yet-cooperating parts, you can build one superordinate Business&#xD;
    Use-Case Model that describes the whole business, followed by one subordinate Business Use-Case Model for each business&#xD;
    area. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_system_BB28EEB.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{4064F184-314B-4965-9F08-6AE5DBF6205A}&quot;>Business systems&lt;/a> can be used to define the various areas of&#xD;
    responsibility, different physical locations, or interacting parts of the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To explore realizations of the superordinate business use cases, you can identify business systems and show how they&#xD;
    collaborate to perform the workflow. At this level, a business system corresponds to a business area. Collaborations&#xD;
    between the business systems can be explicitly defined and clarified using interfaces at a business level. These&#xD;
    &quot;interfaces&quot; describe the set of responsibilities provided by the business system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;443&quot; alt=&quot;Superordinate and subordinate models of an organization&quot; src=&quot;resources/large2.gif&quot; width=&quot;592&quot;&#xD;
    border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    Superordinate and subordinate models of an organization&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;273&quot; alt=&quot;Image described in the following content&quot; src=&quot;resources/large4.gif&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this example, we see the superordinate business use case Request Proposal being refined into the subordinate&#xD;
    business use cases Request Proposal, Plan and Estimate Project, and Estimate Resource Costs at the business system&#xD;
    level. The superordinate business use case Supply Resources has been refined into the subordinate business use cases&#xD;
    Determine Resource Needs and Purchase Raw Materials at the business system level.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each business system can then be treated as an organization of its own, fulfilling the interfaces defined in the&#xD;
    superordinate Business Analysis Model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The derivation of subordinate business use cases (having established the required interfaces for each business system&#xD;
    to realize the superordinate business use cases) can proceed in a manner analogous to that described in &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/use_case_flowdown_6BF482DB.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_6SxgEOM9EdmaZcY4PeqVxA&quot;>Concept: Use-Case Flowdown&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Layered Business Models&quot; name=&quot;Layered Business Models&quot;>Layered Business Models&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In software engineering, a technique used to master the complexity of very large systems is called layering. The idea&#xD;
    behind this technique is to separate the application-specific parts from the more general parts of the system, so that&#xD;
    the program units and program services can be reused. When structuring organizations, the same principles are often&#xD;
    naturally applied. For example, in the bottom layer you find resources that provide general services; somewhere in the&#xD;
    middle layer you often find resources that support business-specific activities; and in the top layer you find business&#xD;
    area-specific or product-specific specialists, Research and Development, and sales force activities. Core business use&#xD;
    cases use resources from all layers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore, layering is not a question of qualifications or seniority, but of uniqueness and importance in relation to&#xD;
    the company's business ideas. A task handled by a business worker from the general skill layer could be as qualified as&#xD;
    any other. The work in core business use cases and supporting business use cases where business-specific information&#xD;
    systems, production lines, and other types of business infrastructure are developed, may require equally&#xD;
    business-specific skills from the same layered organization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_system_4B3288B3.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;5.503233494422666E-306&quot;>Guideline: Business System&lt;/a> contains an example of business systems and their&#xD;
    interfaces. While this example does not explicitly illustrate layers, the business systems in this example are layered&#xD;
    implicitly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For an explanation of the terms &quot;core,&quot; &quot;supporting,&quot; and &quot;management business use case,&quot; see &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;3.9905535055726305E-306&quot;>Technique: Business Use Case Model&lt;/a>-specifically the section on different categories&#xD;
    of business use cases.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Business Use Cases and Classes in a Layered Model&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Structuring the organization into layers does not change the business use case, because the same results still need to&#xD;
    be produced. It does, however, change the business use-case realizations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Compared to a non-layered Business Analysis Model, a layered Business Analysis Model should be developed with two&#xD;
    recommended restrictions in mind:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A business worker in a certain layer never makes contact with a business worker or manipulates a business entity of&#xD;
        a higher layer, except on explicit request from someone in the higher layer. Similarly, business events from higher&#xD;
        layers should not be propagated to lower layers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A business worker has responsibilities only within his or her own layer.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Without these restrictions, a layered structure quickly degenerates. Note that these restrictions apply to the case&#xD;
    where the most general parts of the business are found in lower layers, while the most specific (regarding a particular&#xD;
    market segment) are found in the upper layers. Organization charts tend to be the other way around-from general at the&#xD;
    top to specific at the bottom.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When identifying business workers and assigning activities to them, the skills needed in order to perform an activity&#xD;
    needs to be understood. A business worker from the layer that organizes resources for those particular skills must&#xD;
    perform an activity that by its nature requires a particular skill. Instead of having as few business workers as&#xD;
    possible, which is the normal rule of thumb when designing a business use case, you should now have as few business&#xD;
    workers as possible-with as wide responsibilities as possible-in each layer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Workflows, business workers, business entities, and business events in lower layers should be designed with generality&#xD;
    in mind to provide services shaped for reuse in several areas. Business workers and business entities can be organized&#xD;
    into business systems according to their business specificity. Business systems that include the most general&#xD;
    competencies and phenomena are found in the bottom layer; while the most company-specific business systems are found in&#xD;
    the top layer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Core Business Use Cases versus Supporting Business Use Cases&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Core Business Use Cases versus Supporting Business Use Cases&quot;>Core Business Use Cases vs. Supporting Business Use&#xD;
    Cases&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business use-case realizations will, to differing degrees, engage business workers from different layers. Business&#xD;
    use-case realizations with a high degree of top-layer involvement (highly specific) set the profile of the company,&#xD;
    implement the business idea and function as the profit centers. These correspond to core business use cases and&#xD;
    supporting business use cases to provide core business use cases with essential, business-area-specific infrastructure.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business use-case realizations in lower layers, without top layer business workers, provide the general services&#xD;
    required to keep the company running. They can be abstract and define workflows performed as parts of other business&#xD;
    use cases-for example, billing activities that conclude a sales business use case. They can also be concrete, executing&#xD;
    on their own and performing activities that do not need business area-specific competence, like bookkeeping. These&#xD;
    normally correspond to supporting business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A layered structure reflects those kinds of skills that are key to the business ideas, whether needed in core business&#xD;
    use cases or supporting business use cases, as well as those skills that are less specific. This could be a good&#xD;
    starting point for systematically analyzing the company's available resources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Models of the Entire Organization&quot; name=&quot;Models of the Entire Organization&quot;>Models of the Entire&#xD;
    Organization&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In many cases, you are interested only in detailed information about one or a few of your business processes. However,&#xD;
    to provide context, it can be practical to identify the complete set of business process and briefly describe each of&#xD;
    them. This results in a model that includes core business use cases, supporting business use cases, and management&#xD;
    business use cases. See the section on different categories of business use cases in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_use-case_model_1C8E857B.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;3.9905535055726305E-306&quot;>Technique: Business Use Case Model&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Supporting business use cases-such as core business use cases, business-specific information systems, computer&#xD;
    networks, and premises-are responsible for the development and maintenance of a company's infrastructure, among others.&#xD;
    From the modeling perspective, there are no real differences between core business use cases and supporting business&#xD;
    use cases. Both types of business use cases should have the same requirements of usability and effectiveness. To&#xD;
    perform successfully, both kinds of business use cases might require the same types of resource.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A supporting business use case in one organization-for example a software development business use case-might be a core&#xD;
    business use case in another. The major difference is for whom the business use cases work. At the request of a&#xD;
    business owner, the supporting business use cases develop the business in cooperation with the affected business use&#xD;
    case owners and operators. In a model of the entire business, a typical business actor would be the Board. When the&#xD;
    modeling is delimited to the supporting business use cases only, typical business actors are Business Use-Case Owner&#xD;
    and Business Use-Case Operator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Management business use cases, on the other hand, are responsible for managing the business; that is, for running and&#xD;
    developing the other business use cases according to directives from the owner in order to initiate and supervise core&#xD;
    business use cases and supporting business use cases according to directives from the owner. The Business Analysis&#xD;
    Model describes how executives, resource owners, business use-case owners, business-use case leaders, and business&#xD;
    use-case operators need to cooperate. Typical business actors are the Owner or the Board.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    A model of an entire organization&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    At the other end of the scale, many minor tasks must be taken care of, such as keeping the computer network running,&#xD;
    answering the phone, and cleaning the coffee machine. These tasks, however, are not part of a defined business use&#xD;
    case. For example, if you intend to be certified according to the ISO 9000 Standard, these activities need to be&#xD;
    included in the model as well. A straightforward approach is provided by this rule of thumb: If it is a full-time job,&#xD;
    assign the activity to a specific business worker. If it is less than a full-time job, assign the activity to an&#xD;
    existing business worker with the right skill requirements without trying to include it in any business use case.&#xD;
