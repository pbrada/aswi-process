&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business-modeling effort can have different scopes depending on context and need. Six such scenarios are listed&#xD;
    below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #1-Organization Chart&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You may want to build a simple map of the organization and its processes to get a better understanding of what the&#xD;
    requirements are on the application you are building. In this case, business modeling is part of the&#xD;
    software-engineering project, primarily performed during the inception phase. These types of efforts often start out as&#xD;
    merely charting with no intent of changing the organization, however, in reality, building and deploying a new&#xD;
    application always includes some level of &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_improvement_6638C494.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x8yYBNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business improvement&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #2-Domain Modeling&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are building applications with the primary purpose of managing and presenting information, such as an order&#xD;
    management system or a banking system, you may choose to build a model of that information at a business level, without&#xD;
    considering the workflows of the business. This is referred to as domain modeling. Typically, domain modeling is part&#xD;
    of the software-engineering project, and is performed during the inception and elaboration phases of the project.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #3-One Business Many Systems&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are building a large system, or a family of applications, you may have one business-modeling effort that will&#xD;
    serve as input to several software-engineering projects. The business models help you find functional requirements, and&#xD;
    they serve as input to building the architecture of the application family. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/going_from_business_models_to_systems_3B55D8F4.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;1.3212739617274792E-306&quot;>Guideline: Going from Business Models to Systems&lt;/a>. The business-modeling effort is,&#xD;
    in this case, often treated as a project on its own.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #4-Generic Business Model&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are building an application that will be used by several organizations-for example, a sales support application&#xD;
    or a billing application &lt;span&#xD;
    style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA&quot;>-&lt;/span>it&#xD;
    can be useful to go through a business-modeling effort to align the organizations as to how they do their business to&#xD;
    avoid requirements that are too complex for the system (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_improvement_6638C494.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x8yYBNnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business improvement&lt;/a>). If aligning the organizations is not an option, however, a&#xD;
    business-modeling effort can help you understand and manage differences in how the organizations will use the&#xD;
    application and will make it easier to determine which application functionality should be prioritized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #5-New Business&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If an organization has decided to start a completely new line of business (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_creation_ABCA16F6.html&quot; guid=&quot;_x8e2CdnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business&#xD;
    creation&lt;/a>), and will build information systems to support it, a business-modeling effort needs to be performed. In&#xD;
    this case, the purpose of business modeling is not only to find requirements on systems, but also to determine the&#xD;
    feasibility of the new line of business. The business-modeling effort is, in this case, often treated as a project on&#xD;
    its own.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Scenario #6-Revamp&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If an organization has decided to completely revamp their way of doing business (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/termdefinitions/business_reengineering_8A1CC1F0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_x87h-dnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>business reengineering&lt;/a>), business modeling is often one or several projects in its&#xD;
    own right. Typically, business reengineering is done in several stages: envision the new business, reverse-engineer the&#xD;
    existing business, forward-engineer the new business, and install the new business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
