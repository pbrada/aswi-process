    Introduction&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Functional Area Analysis uses&amp;nbsp;a partitioning of the business, such as a CBM Component Model and Heat Map, as a&#xD;
    starting point or input. Business domains are identified (for example, from CBM competencies) and further decomposed&#xD;
    into sub-domains and ultimately into functional areas (for example, using CBM Components as input). Functional areas&#xD;
    also suggest potential subsystem boundaries used for service component identification.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Functional Area Analysis begins by creating summary descriptions that identify the major high level functional&#xD;
    responsibilities of each domain.&amp;nbsp;Next, each domain is decomposed into smaller, more discrete, functional areas.&#xD;
    Each functional area is described in terms of the specific functions it is responsible for, as well as functions it&#xD;
    depends on during collaborations with other functional areas.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;181&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram is described in associated text&quot; src=&quot;./resources/functional_areas_fig11.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;402&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;>&lt;strong>CBM input mapped to Functional Area Description elements&lt;/strong>&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Input from a business analysis activity can save time, and should be used if available. If functional area analysis is&#xD;
    being carried out using input from Component Business Modeling (CBM), a Domain will typically map to a CBM Competency,&#xD;
    CBM business components are a good starting point for the identification of functional areas, and CBM Component&#xD;
    Services and Activities are a good way to identify functions.&amp;nbsp;CBM components often map&amp;nbsp;one-to-one to&#xD;
    functional areas, although in some cases a CBM component may be too coarse grained, encompassing too many types of&#xD;
    functions.&amp;nbsp;In that case it would need to be further decomposed into multiple functional areas.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Functional Area Analysis begins by locating and summarizing descriptions of the domains and the activities within&#xD;
    domains relevant to the business modeling initiative.&amp;nbsp; Each of these domains is decomposed into smaller, more&#xD;
    discrete, functional areas.&amp;nbsp;Each functional area is concisely described in terms of the functions it is&#xD;
    responsible for, as well as functions it depends on from other functional areas.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where CBM input is used, then the CBM Competencies identified in the CBM Component Map can be treated as domains and&#xD;
    CBM Components can be considered as functional areas.&amp;nbsp; A CBM Heat Map&amp;nbsp;can be&amp;nbsp;used to determine which&#xD;
    Competencies and Components should be the focus of this analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Example&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We begin with a CBM Component Model that is depicted in the Component Map below. This figure shows the CBM competencies&#xD;
    for the Rent-a-car example in the top row of the Component Map table.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;206&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram is described in associated text&quot; src=&quot;./resources/technique_fig24.gif&quot; width=&quot;480&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Rent-a-car&lt;/em> CBM competencies&lt;/strong>&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Descriptions of each competency in the CBM Component Model are shown in Table 6.&amp;nbsp; These descriptions will save&#xD;
    time when we describe the domains that are the focus of Functional Area Analysis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;229&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram is described in associated text&quot; src=&quot;./resources/technique_fig25.gif&quot; width=&quot;516&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Rent-a-car&lt;/em> CBM heat map&lt;/strong>&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hot components in the CBM Heat Map indicate competencies that will be the focus of Functional Area Analysis. The figure&#xD;
    above shows the four hot components -- the key components for the current SOA initiative in our running example.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    The competencies associated with these hot components become the focus domain areas for Functional Area Analysis:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Marketing and Customer Management (Customer Service is a hot component)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Products (Promotions Management is a hot component)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rentals Management (Rentals and Reservations is a hot component)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rental Fleet Logistics (Fleet Management is a hot component)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Descriptions of each CBM component are shown in Table 6.&amp;nbsp;Component descriptions provide insight into the&#xD;
    functional responsibilities of domain focus areas and facilitate decomposition of domains into functional areas.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each domain is analyzed to identify the major functions it is responsible for.&amp;nbsp;Analysis results can be captured in&#xD;
    a visual model that groups functional areas by domain as shown below.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;122&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram is described in associated text&quot; src=&quot;./resources/functional_areas_fig7.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;623&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;font size=&quot;-2&quot;>&lt;strong>&lt;em>Rent-a-car&lt;/em> Functional area analysis decomposition&lt;/strong>&lt;/font>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For Rent-a-car, we break the domains into functional areas by identifying major functional responsibilities for each&#xD;
    domain in focus: Marketing and Customer management, Products, Rental Fleet Logistics, and Rentals Management.&amp;nbsp; CBM&#xD;
    components of these domains provide the starting point for this analysis:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A major functional area of the Marketing and Customer Management domain is Customer Service.&amp;nbsp; Since Customer&#xD;
        Service directly pertains to the running example (it plays a direct role in rental-related activities), it will be&#xD;
        further analyzed.&amp;nbsp; Other functional areas of this domain may be of interest to a different initiative, but&#xD;
        since they do not play direct roles in this specific example, they will not be analyzed in detail at this time.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For the Products domain, Promotions Management is a major functional area identified for further analysis since&#xD;
        promotions affect rental pricing.&amp;nbsp; Once again, although there are other functional areas that fall within this&#xD;
        domain, the focus area for Functional Area Analysis will be on the functional areas that are directly relevant to&#xD;
        this SOA initiative.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Fleet Management is a major functional area for the Rental Fleet Logistics domain that plays a role in the&#xD;
        reservation process, for example where vehicle availability information is important.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rentals Management has been decomposed into three major functional areas: Rental, Reservations, and Pricing.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
        In this case the hot component Rentals and Reservations does not map one to one to functional areas as was the case&#xD;
        for the other domains.&amp;nbsp; The Reservation and Rental functional areas provide the most customer visible aspects&#xD;
        of the car rental experience.&amp;nbsp; Pricing is a key function for completing a reservation, as well as for&#xD;
        completion of the vehicle rental at check-in (note that the function being referred to here is not the same as&#xD;
        Pricing Management -- Pricing in this domain involves setting a price for a specific reservation or rental based on&#xD;
        a number of factors such as type of vehicle, type of customer, etc.).&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These will be the core functional areas for the next steps in this example.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The decision to designate three functional areas instead of one is a result of anticipating that these functional areas&#xD;
    will be used in other SOMA steps, such as categories in the service hierarchy and subsystem boundaries to group&#xD;
    functionally related components.&amp;nbsp; At this early stage of the SOMA process, Rentals and Reservations looks like&#xD;
    such a large functional area (i.e. encompassing many functions) that it could have become unwieldy to use in later&#xD;
    steps.&amp;nbsp; As is the case with other modeling techniques, we may find out later in the process, when more is known,&#xD;
    that representing these three as a single subsystem will work fine (this in fact will be the case as we will see later&#xD;
    in the paper).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There is actually an overlap across several domains regarding pricing, but we have chosen to emphasize just the pricing&#xD;
    aspect of Rentals Management since that this is the aspect of pricing that is most directly related to the&#xD;
    example.&amp;nbsp; The Products domain establishes baseline pricing guidelines that account for standard cost and profit&#xD;
    policies.&amp;nbsp; Marketing and Customer Management information combined with information from Rental Fleet Logistics&#xD;
    information and other marketplace related criteria supports special promotional pricing by the Products domain.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    Marketing and Customer Management influences the criteria by which pricing schedules are applied to various customer&#xD;
    types.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Nevertheless, whatever led to the establishment of pricing schedules, in this specific running example, it is Rentals&#xD;
    Management where the prices are actually used during the reservation and rental.&amp;nbsp; In a different scenario, other&#xD;
    aspects of pricing could be the focus area.&amp;nbsp; This is the type of insight that CBM and SOMA can bring to the&#xD;
    customer, potentially leading to future initiatives and greater business value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Further analysis will consider the interdependencies that begin to emerge as analysis delves deeper into these&#xD;
    functions.&amp;nbsp; For example, as part of Reservations, it would be advantageous to adjust pricing due to oversupply of&#xD;
    vehicles of a particular class at a particular location that Fleet Management is aware of.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each functional area is described with a concise textual explanation as shown in the Rent-a-Car Functional Area&#xD;
    Description Table example.&amp;nbsp; Input from a business analysis technique like CBM can save time: CBM Component&#xD;
    descriptions that helped to identify functional areas also provide details that can be used to describe each functional&#xD;
    area and its associated functions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Functional Area Interactions and Dependencies&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As each functional area is being analyzed and described in terms of its functions, it is also analyzed in the larger&#xD;
    context of its relationships to other functional areas (i.e. the interactions and collaborations among functional&#xD;
    areas) are identified.&amp;nbsp; This information will be used later as an input to subsystem analysis, which considers,&#xD;
    among other things, the interactions among subsystems (which Functional Areas are used to identify) and Service&#xD;
    Components within the subsystems.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The partitioning of the business domain results in a set of functional areas.&amp;nbsp; These functional areas will contain&#xD;
    aggregates of cohesive functionality called subsystems.&amp;nbsp; Each subsystem is a conceptual mechanism by which the&#xD;
    boundaries of the potentially cohesive set of service components are defined.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The identification of subsystems as a result of functional area analysis allows the seamless transition from business&#xD;
    identification of functional areas to the determination of which subsystems are actually involved in the implementation&#xD;
    of a given functional area.&amp;nbsp; The subsystems become a blueprint for reuse.&amp;nbsp; It provides us with an abstract&#xD;
    behavior of not only the internal functioning of the subsystems but also contracts by which subsystems collaborate and&#xD;
    depend upon one another.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Subsystems bridge the gap between business (as defined by functional areas) and IT (as realized by service components).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A final step is to identify a candidate subsystem for each functional area.&amp;nbsp; In many cases there will be&#xD;
    a&amp;nbsp;one-to-one relationship between functional areas and subsystems.&amp;nbsp; If it appears that multiple subsystems&#xD;
    could be required, this is an indication that the functional area may need to be reassessed, split into one or more&#xD;
    additional functional areas, each taking on a subset of the original functional area's functions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Functional Areas&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Functional areas form the basis for defining the boundaries of IT subsystems, and provide a means to classify candidate&#xD;
    services.&amp;nbsp; Functional areas are used as a starting point for subsystems and Service Component&#xD;
    identification.&amp;nbsp; Functional areas are the lowest level of granularity to which a domain is decomposed.&amp;nbsp; In&#xD;
    this work product, each functional area is concisely described in terms of the functions it is responsible for, as well&#xD;
    as functions it depends on from other functional areas.&amp;nbsp; Functional areas provide sets of cohesive business&#xD;
    functions for the domain (i.e. are subsets of the overall domain functionality).&amp;nbsp; The identification of clearly&#xD;
    defined functional areas is important for the success of business modeling initiatives because functional areas are a&#xD;
    key to establishing cohesive business aligned groups of services and the subsystems that will be used to realize those&#xD;
    services.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Candidate subsystems identified in this work product are further analyzed leading to the identification of the Service&#xD;
    Components that will be used to realize (implement) the services associated with the subsystem.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A service component is a realization of a subsystem, a logical grouping of functionally-cohesive business-aligned&#xD;
    services, which is important enough to the enterprise to be managed and governed as an enterprise asset.&amp;nbsp; These&#xD;
    business-aligned services can be exposed at a variety of boundaries, including the edge of the enterprise or a business&#xD;
    unit.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Any business is composed of business domains, a logical grouping of business capabilities (functionalities) that&#xD;
    provide related business functions and require similar skills and expertise. To explain the concept of business domain,&#xD;
    consider the following simplified example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        What the Business is selling? -- Products Domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To whom the Business is selling and how to improve it? -- Customer Relationship Management and Marketing Domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When and how to sell? -- Sales Management Domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        How to Manage the Business? -- Business Administration Domain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Domains can be broken down (decomposed) into Functional Areas.&amp;nbsp; Functional areas provide a set of cohesive&#xD;
    business functions for the domain.&amp;nbsp; For example, a functional area in the Products Domain could be Product&#xD;
    Development, whose main function is to develop and enhance the products.&#xD;
