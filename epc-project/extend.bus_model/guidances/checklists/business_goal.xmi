  <sections xmi:id="_BtgmkCzFEdunTsKJjZp1Kg" name="Do all Business Systems have defined goals" guid="_BtgmkCzFEdunTsKJjZp1Kg">
    <sectionDescription>Business systems represent functional domains in a business, each functional domain should be guided by goals. Business&#xD;
system goals can either be unique to the system or sub-goals of goals defined for the business as a whole. There will&#xD;
usually be a parallel decomposition of goals and business systems with each system having it's own goals and inheriting&#xD;
goals from parent systems.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Is the goal related to competitive advantage</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>Goals, in general, should encompass areas of competitive advantage and should be leading a business to expand on such&#xD;
advantages. Obviously some business goals are related more to the management of the business, but these should be&#xD;
outnumbered by those representing business competencies.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="__9SwsCzFEdunTsKJjZp1Kg" name="Is the name unique" guid="__9SwsCzFEdunTsKJjZp1Kg">
    <sectionDescription>It is important to uniquely name goals so as to ensure that goals can be easily distinguished. It is also possible to use a&#xD;
hierarchical numbering system as a part of the goals name; for example (1) for the parent goals, (1.1), (1.2), etc. for&#xD;
sub-goals.</sectionDescription>

  <sections xmi:id="_OQ_f0CzGEdunTsKJjZp1Kg" name="Does the name reflect the intention of the goal" guid="_OQ_f0CzGEdunTsKJjZp1Kg">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The name of a goal should reflect its intention; while a goal has a description field it will most often be presented&#xD;
    in reports and other material simply by its name.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Is the goal unambiguous</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>Is the description of the goal unambiguous? All stakeholders should be able to agree not only on the validity of a goal but&#xD;
also its meaning and value.</sectionDescription>
  </sections>
  <sections xmi:id="_enDvUCzGEdunTsKJjZp1Kg" name="Are KPIs included for all goals" guid="_enDvUCzGEdunTsKJjZp1Kg">
    <sectionDescription>All goals should be supported by a set of Key Performance Indicators which describe the manner in which the business will&#xD;
measure success. A goal that has sub-goals can choose to not have explicit KPIs&amp;nbsp;if its sub-goals have defined and&#xD;
measurable KPIs.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Is it clear how the goal contributes to any higher level goals it supports</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>Each sub-goal should clearly support any higher-level goal. A parent goal can choose to not have associated KPIs if it is&#xD;
clear how all sub-goal KPIs can be combined to define its own measures.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Is there at least one business use case that traces to the goal</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>The primary mechanism for a business to enact its goals is through the execution of business processes. Business processes&#xD;
may be represented either directly using a process modeling tool, or may be represented using a Business Use Case (with the&#xD;
UML Profile for Business Modeling).</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Does the goal conflict with any other goals</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>Goals should be validated to ensure they do not conflict; this is particularly important in a goal model where sub-goals&#xD;
may be modeled and maintained by different business organizations.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Is the goal traced to other goals to which it may contribute</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>Goals may naturally form a hierarchy with goal/sub-goal relationships. It is also possible for a goal model to form more of&#xD;
a network or matrix with sub-goals contributing to more than one parent goal. Ensure that all such relationships are&#xD;
explicitly modeled.</sectionDescription>

    <sectionName> Is the hierarchy of goals more than three-to-five levels deep</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A goal model needs to be precise enough to be measurable and enactable; if you have less than three levels, you must&#xD;
    verify whether these goals are concrete enough to be measurable. If more than seven, you may consider flattening the&#xD;
    hierarchy.&#xD;

    <sectionName> Is the hierarchy balanced</sectionName>
    <sectionDescription>Do different sub-trees at the same level in the hierarchy have similar depth? If not, it may indicate that one area has&#xD;
received more attention than others.</sectionDescription>
