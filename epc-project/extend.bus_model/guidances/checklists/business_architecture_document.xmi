    If it is the case, &amp;nbsp;the business architecture will in general appear to be reasonable. Past experience with the&#xD;
    architecture can be a good indicator if the rate of change in the architecture is low, and remains low as new scenarios&#xD;
    are covered, there is good reason to believe that the architecture is stabilizing. Conversely, if each new scenario&#xD;
    causes changes in the architecture, it isstill evolving and baselining is not yet warranted.&lt;br />&#xD;
