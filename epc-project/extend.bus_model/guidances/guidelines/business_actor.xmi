&lt;p>&#xD;
    To fully understand the purpose of a business you must know &lt;b>who&lt;/b> the business interacts with; that is, who puts&#xD;
    demands on it, or is interested in its output. The different types of &quot;interactors&quot; are represented as &lt;b>business&#xD;
    actors&lt;/b>&lt;i>.&lt;/i>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The term actor means the role someone, or something plays while interacting with the business. The following types of&#xD;
    business users are examples of potential business actors:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Suppliers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Partners&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Potential customers (the &quot;market place&quot;)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Local authorities&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Colleagues in parts of the business not modeled.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Hence, an actor normally corresponds to a human user. However, there are situations where, for instance, an information&#xD;
    system plays the role of an actor. If your bank's on-line services are so good that your business can manage most of&#xD;
    its bank transactions from a PC on your own premises, your use cases interacting with the &quot;money supplier&quot; actor, the&#xD;
    bank, will in fact interact with an information system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An actor represents a particular type of business user rather than a real physical user. Several physical users of a&#xD;
    business can play the same role in relation to it; that is, they act as instances of one and the same actor. Also, the&#xD;
    same user can act as several different actors. This means that one and the same person can embody instances of&#xD;
    different actors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business actor should be given a name that reflects its role towards the business. The name should be applicable to&#xD;
    any person-or any information system-playing the role.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The characteristics of a business actor should cover the following topics:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Prior knowledge and experience.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Physical characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Social and physical environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Job, tasks, and requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Cognitive characteristics.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This information is useful to define the business use cases in a way that is meaningful to the business actor. It is&#xD;
    only relevant for &quot;human&quot; business actors.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Characteristics&quot; name=&quot;Characteristics&quot;>Checklist for Good Business Actors&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All actors are found. Everything in the business environment interactions-both human and mechanical-is modeled with&#xD;
        actors. You cannot be sure of finding every actor until you have found and described every use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each human actor expresses a role, not a specific person. You should be able to name at least two persons that can&#xD;
        play the role of each actor. If you can't, you may have modeled a person, not a role. Of course, there are&#xD;
        situations in which you can find only one person who can play a role.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each actor models something outside the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each actor is involved with at least one use case. If an actor does not interact with at least one use case, you&#xD;
        should remove it.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A specific actor does not interact with the business in several completely different ways. If an actor interacts in&#xD;
        several completely different ways, you have probably assigned several roles to one actor. In that case, you should&#xD;
        split the actor into several actors, each representing a different role.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each actor has an explanatory name and description. An actor's name should represent the role it plays in relation&#xD;
        to the business. The name must be understandable to people outside the business-modeling team.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
