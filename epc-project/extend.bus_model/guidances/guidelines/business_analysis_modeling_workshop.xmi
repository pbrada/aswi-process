    This workshop focuses on ftinding business workers and business entities that participate in one business use-case&#xD;
    realization. A productive way of working is to gather a group of 3-7 people, use a whiteboard, easel, and Post-it&lt;font&#xD;
    size=&quot;1&quot;>?&lt;/font>Notes. As the workshop progresses, your results should fill the walls of the room, making sure that&#xD;
    everyone can see and compare the different types of diagrams that will show different aspects of the realization of a&#xD;
    business process. These diagrams are here presented in a sequence you would introduce them, but once introduced they&#xD;
    will evolve in parallel.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Study the workflow of a business use-case. Mark each section in your text to show responsibilities that would fit on&#xD;
    one business worker or business entity. Or,if you have drawn an activity diagram for the workflow, mark up activity&#xD;
    states in the diagram. Use two colors of Post-it&lt;font size=&quot;1&quot;>?&lt;/font> Notes: one for business workers,and one for&#xD;
    entities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Create a new activity diagram, with one swimlane for each business worker that you a this point know is participating.&#xD;
    Discuss how tasks are divided among the participating business workers - some tasks may need to be split,some could be&#xD;
    merged.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;403&quot; alt=&quot;Activity Diagram example with Swimlanes&quot; src=&quot;resources/md_bact8.gif&quot; width=&quot;547&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Example of activity diagram with swimlanes.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once you understand what responsibilities each business worker has, you may start to add the business entities into the&#xD;
    picture using object flows in the activity diagrams. However, to avoid clutter you often need to limit the business&#xD;
    entities you show to those that are primary to the workflow. For details of business entities class diagrams are a&#xD;
    better choice.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;612&quot; alt=&quot;activity diagram with object flows added&quot; src=&quot;resources/md_bact10.gif&quot; width=&quot;608&quot;&#xD;
    border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Example of an activity diagram with object flows added.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To summarize your results, you can create class diagram that shows the business workers and the primary business&#xD;
    entities. In this class diagram, you can also start to add the relationships between business workers and business&#xD;
    entities that are necessary to perform the workflow of the business use-case realization.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the number of business workers and business entities is large, you mayneed several diagrams. The following is&#xD;
    recommended:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        One diagram that shows how the business workers interact (without showing any business entities).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A diagram for each subflow of the business use-case realization. Each of these diagrams should contain just the&#xD;
        business workers and business entities involved in the subflow. You could even limit the diagram by showing only&#xD;
        the most interesting business entities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;308&quot; alt=&quot;A class diagram shows how business workers and business entities are related&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;resources/bcoldm1.gif&quot; width=&quot;426&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    A class diagram shows how business workers and business entities are related to perform a business use-case realization&#xD;
    workflow.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As previously mentioned, it can be useful to in a separate class diagram keep track of the business entities on how&#xD;
    they need to be related.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;60&quot; alt=&quot;A class diagram showing the business entities and their relationships.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bent2.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;325&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    A class diagram showing the business entities and their relationships.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sequence diagrams, which are often more descriptive than activity diagrams, are good for describing the workflow in the&#xD;
    following situations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When parts of the business use-case realization are complex or unclear.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When there are few business workers and business entities involved, but many operations to perform.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        When it is important to show the exact sequence in a workflow, that is, of messages for operations by business&#xD;
        workers and messages to operations of business entities.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the number of business workers and business entities is large, you mayneed several sequence diagrams. Our&#xD;
    recommendations for communication diagrams are also valid for sequence diagrams. Start with the use-case&#xD;
    realization?snormal workflow, following its structure. Continue with alternative subflows.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To draw a sequence diagram of a business use-case realization, do the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Put all business workers and business entities that participate in the workflow into a sequence diagram.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Describe how the business workers interact via messages. For each message, specify the operation it concerns. If a&#xD;
        business worker handles a business entity, specify the operation it concerns.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In the text margin, describe each activation (message requesting an operation).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;286&quot; alt=&quot;A sequence diagram documents how business workers interact&quot; src=&quot;resources/bseqdm1.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;327&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    A sequence diagram documents how business workers interact and handle business entities to perform the workflow of a&#xD;
    businessuse-case realization.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you are ready, save the information about each business worker and business entity (which tasks it is supposed to&#xD;
    perform). You will describe them later. Save the information about the business use case and its realization by copying&#xD;
    the contents of the whiteboard. A great way of copying is to take a picture of the whiteboard with a digital camera. A&#xD;
    digital picture can be shared on a project home page.&lt;br />&#xD;
