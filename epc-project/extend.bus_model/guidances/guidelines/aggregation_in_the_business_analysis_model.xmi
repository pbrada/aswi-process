&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes a group of people act as a single unit in a use case, or, more generally, a phenomenon is composed of other&#xD;
    independent phenomena. For example, School Class consists of Students. Such a phenomenon is called an aggregate.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Aggregates are modeled with a separate class for the composite phenomenon. Such classes have aggregations to the&#xD;
    classes that represent its constituents. This construction makes it possible to both refer to the components&#xD;
    individually and handle them as a single unit. The uniting class does not necessarily have many properties of its own.&#xD;
    Its essential characteristic may very well be the aggregations of the different components.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;p>&#xD;
        A company's board of directors consists of the chairman, the chief executive officer, and several owner&#xD;
        representatives.&#xD;
    &lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    An aggregate class holds other classes together.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should use aggregates only if they are necessary; that is, if both the aggregate and any of its constituents are&#xD;
    supposed to act or be useful on their own. A good aggregate is a natural, coherent part of a business analysis&#xD;
    model-its meaning should be easy to understand from the context.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Aggregations should only be used with classes representing the same kind of phenomenon. For example, it does not make&#xD;
    sense for a business entity to be an aggregate of business workers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
