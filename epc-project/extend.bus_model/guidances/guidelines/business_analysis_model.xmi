&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business Analysis Model defines the realization of the business use cases, from the internal viewpoint of the&#xD;
    business systems and business workers. The model defines how people and systems working in the business, and the things&#xD;
    they handle and use (business entities), must relate to one another, both statically and dynamically, to produce&#xD;
    the&amp;nbsp;desired results. It places emphasis on roles performed in the business areas, and their active&#xD;
    responsibilities. The model will show all collaborations needed to realize all business use cases, and all classes from&#xD;
    which objects will be instantiated to bind&amp;nbsp;(fulfill) those roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The key elements of the Business Analysis Model are:&#xD;

        guid=&quot;5.503233494422666E-306&quot;>Business Systems&lt;/a> partition large business models into interdependent areas of&#xD;
        responsibilities. Business Systems encapsulate their resources, and provide services through well-defined&#xD;
        interfaces, to other parts of the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

        guid=&quot;2.0515380886761288E-306&quot;>Business Workers&lt;/a> are the active units of a business - in the Business Analysis&#xD;
        Model they represent an abstraction of a human or software, or even a system containing humans, hardware and&#xD;
        software (which, unlike a business system, will not be further decomposed within the Business Analysis or Business&#xD;
        Design Models). Their responsibilities are defined in the Business Analysis Model.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Analysis Model brings the notions of structure and behavior together. Business Use-Case Realizations map&#xD;
    the descriptions of process (Business Use Cases), which specify desired behavior, to structural elements within the&#xD;
    organization (see the figure that appears after the bullets).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are some characteristics of the Business Analysis Model:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is a bridging artifact that articulates business concerns in a way that is familiar to software developers,&#xD;
        while still retaining a purely business content. It is a consolidation of what we know about the area of business&#xD;
        concern expressed in terms of objects, attributes, and responsibilities.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It explores the essence of business area knowledge in a way that provides a transition from thinking about business&#xD;
        issues to thinking about software applications.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It is a way of firming up requirements to be enabled or supported by information systems that will be built.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The process of agreeing to business object definitions, relationships between objects, and the names for the&#xD;
        objects and relationships between objects, permits business area knowledge to be represented in a precise manner&#xD;
        that can be understood and validated by business-area experts.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    id=&quot;How to Name Business Workers and Business Entities&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;How to Name Business Workers and Business Entities&quot;>Naming Conventions&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In general, Business Systems, Business Workers, Business Entities, and Business Events should have short, descriptive&#xD;
    names that are unique and are not similar to other names. Sometimes it may be necessary to use more than one word to&#xD;
    describe the purpose of the model element and ensure that it is unique and recognizable, especially when considering a&#xD;
    broader context (which may become important in the future).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Business System provides a collection of related responsibilities with a specific purpose, and should be named in a&#xD;
    way that reflects this purpose. It may be tempting to use generic names or catch phrases for names (such as Client&#xD;
    Services), but make sure that the term is really applicable and descriptive. Generally, a gerund form of a verb is&#xD;
    useful (such as Shipping, Invoicing, or Selling) as is a reference to the purpose of the Business System (such as&#xD;
    Customer Management or Target Acquisition). See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_system_4B3288B3.html&quot; guid=&quot;5.503233494422666E-306&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business System&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Workers should be named in a way that expresses their responsibilities. Do not describe the function (in case&#xD;
    of a human business worker), but the role played by the business worker in the use-case realization. This role is&#xD;
    reflected by the purpose with which the business worker is involved in the business use-case realization. See &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_worker_A7C3AF61.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;2.0515380886761288E-306&quot;>Guideline: Business Worker&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, imagine a process in which data is typed into a system by one business worker and held until a second&#xD;
    business worker has verified or approved the data before processing (such as in loan applications at a bank). The&#xD;
    business worker who inputs the data could be named Data Typist or Data Entry Clerk, whereas the second business worker&#xD;
    could be named Verifier, Authorizer, or Releaser. Data Entry Clerk has the disadvantage of sounding human, while the&#xD;
    last three may have to be further qualified at some stage (for example, Mortgage Authorizer if the bank is also going&#xD;
    to start brokering insurance policies).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Entities should be named in a way that reflects the information they represent. Business entities must always&#xD;
    be defined in the Business Glossary, since there is usually much difference of opinion regarding definitions and&#xD;
    relationships. Do not include the state or properties of the Business Entity in its name. Business Entity names should&#xD;
    be singular, not plural. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_entity_734D1170.html&quot; guid=&quot;1.0295540980844903E-304&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business Entity&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Events should be named in a way that indicates the occurrence or state changed that it represents. Do not&#xD;
    describe the trigger of the event or the reaction to the event in the name. The specification of the event is&#xD;
    independent of its triggers. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_event_213B3FAC.html&quot; guid=&quot;1.3382783818773036E-305&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business Event&lt;/a> for more information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Business Objects in Relation to Business Use Cases&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Business Objects in Relation to Business Use Cases&quot;>Business Objects in Relation to Business Use Cases&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you study the business workers and business entities that participate in your business' different use cases, you may&#xD;
    find several that are so similar that they are really one class. Even when different business use cases do not have&#xD;
    identical demands, the classes may be similar enough to be considered one and the same phenomenon. If this is the case,&#xD;
    merge the similar classes into one. This results in a business worker or business entity that has sufficient&#xD;
    relationships, attributes, and operations to meet all the demands of the different business use cases. The diagram at&#xD;
    the end of the section titled &quot;Explanation&quot; (above) shows how business workers and business entities participate in&#xD;
    different business use-case realizations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Several business use cases may, therefore, have quite different demands on one and the same class. In the case of&#xD;
    business workers, if you have employees capable of acting in the described set of roles, you will also have flexible&#xD;
    employees who can work in several positions. This gives you a more flexible business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_information_systems__business-object_model_relationship_to&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;XE_information_systems__business-object_model_relationship_to&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a&#xD;
    id=&quot;XE_business_object_model__information_systems_the_relationship_to&quot;&#xD;

    id=&quot;The Business Analysis Model and Information Systems&quot; name=&quot;The Business Analysis Model and Information Systems&quot;>The&#xD;
    Business Analysis Model and Information Systems&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In the Business Analysis Model, Business Workers represent the roles that the active units of the business will play,&#xD;
    whereas Business Entities represent those things that the&amp;nbsp;active units&amp;nbsp;will handle. Using a Business Analysis&#xD;
    Model, you define how the&amp;nbsp;Business Workers (and at a higher level, the Business Systems)&amp;nbsp;need to interact to&#xD;
    produce the desired results for the business actor. We said above that a Business Worker may represent an abstraction&#xD;
    of a software system; &lt;em>when you move out of the business modeling context, you will use a System Use-Case Model and&#xD;
    Design Model to specify that software system.&lt;/em>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business modeling and software modeling address different problem&amp;nbsp;domains at two different abstraction levels.&#xD;
    Therefore, as a general rule you should respect this difference, and not allow software modeling details to intrude&#xD;
    into the business models, but focus on the business purpose of the&amp;nbsp;Business Workers.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When you examine the interactions and characteristics of business workers in the 'as-is' model (particularly those&#xD;
    roles played by human workers), the occurrence and consumption of business events, and the operations performed on&#xD;
    business entities, certain relationship heuristics between the business modeling and the system modeling contexts may&#xD;
    be useful, as you look for automation opportunities. Links, associations and attributes in the business model may&#xD;
    suggest possible automation:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An employee acting as a certain business worker corresponds to a system actor of the information system. He or she&#xD;
        is probably best supported if the information systems are structured so that his or her entire work in a business&#xD;
        use case is supported by one system use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Alternatively, if the business use case is large, long-lived, or combines work from several independent areas, an&#xD;
        information-system use case can support one operation of the business worker instead.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The things the business workers manipulate - modeled as business entities - often have representations in the&#xD;
        information systems. In the object model of an information system, these business entities occur as entity classes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business events are often implemented as messages in service-oriented architecture software systems or as tasks in&#xD;
        workflow automation systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Associations and aggregations between business entities often give rise to corresponding association and&#xD;
        aggregations between entity classes in the Design Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Therefore, an information system use case accesses and manipulates entity classes in the design model that&#xD;
        represent the business entities accessed by the supported business use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A&amp;nbsp;business actor that directly uses a business information system also becomes a system actor of the&#xD;
        information system in the system modeling context.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    These relationships are&amp;nbsp;useful when identifying requirements for the information systems to support the&#xD;
    business.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See the section on automated business workers in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/going_from_business_models_to_systems_3B55D8F4.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;1.3212739617274792E-306&quot;>Guideline: Going from Business Models to Systems&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes the employees of one business contact the employees of another business through the use of an information&#xD;
    system in the first business. From the perspective of the modeled business, that information system is a business&#xD;
    actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    A software developer tries to understand a problem in the product for which he is responsible. To understand if the&#xD;
    problem originates from the programming tool he is using, he contacts the supplier's World Wide Web server and studies&#xD;
    the list of known problems in the current release of the programming tool. In this way, the business worker Software&#xD;
    Developer interacts with the business actor Supplier WWW Server.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    name=&quot;Information Systems Explicitly in the Business Analysis Model&quot;>Information Systems Explicitly in the Business&#xD;
    Analysis Model&lt;/a>&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you model manipulations of business entities by business workers, it is evident that many of the operations on the&#xD;
    business entities would be performed with the assistance of some tool - perhaps computer-based. Whether you choose to&#xD;
    model this explicitly as an information or other system (and therefore represent it by a business worker) depends on&#xD;
    its significance in the business. For example, you would probably not model a simple desktop system that has word&#xD;
    processing and spreadsheet capabilities as a business worker in its own right. On the other hand, when you encounter an&#xD;
    information system&amp;nbsp;in a&amp;nbsp;business that&amp;nbsp;is directly used by customers, and this interaction forms a major&#xD;
    part of the business services, it might be so commercially important that you want to show it in the Business Analysis&#xD;
    Model. Telephone banking services are good examples of this type of information system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this case you could proceed as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Regard the information system as a fully automated business worker that interacts with an actor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If the information system relates to any of the other business workers or business entities, consider illustrating&#xD;
        this relationship with a link or an association. Perhaps the system informs a business worker of its progress or&#xD;
        uses information concerning a business entity.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Briefly describe the business worker, as well as a list of services that represents the information system in the&#xD;
        Business Analysis Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Model all details and characteristics of the information system and its environment in a&#xD;
        subordinate&amp;nbsp;Information System Model.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Introduce a naming convention so that a fully automated business worker is easily identified among the business&#xD;
        workers; for example, a prefix or a suffix, like &quot;automated &amp;lt;business worker name&amp;gt;&quot; or &quot;system: &amp;lt;business&#xD;
        worker name&amp;gt;&quot;. You may even define a stereotype with a particular icon.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    id=&quot;Characteristics of a Good Business Analysis Model&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Characteristics of a Good Business Analysis Model&quot;>Characteristics of a Good Business Analysis Model&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Taken together, the business systems, business workers, business entities, and business events perform all tasks&#xD;
    described in the business use cases - no more and no less. The Business Analysis Model gives a good, comprehensive&#xD;
    picture of the organization at an appropriate level of abstraction.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Transition to Business Design Model&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Business Design Model is the evolution of the Business Analysis Model with choices (and associated rationale) for&#xD;
    the realization, and perhaps refactoring, of Business Workers&amp;nbsp;in humans, software or systems (themselves composed&#xD;
    of some or all of humans, software and hardware). The Business Design Model does not decompose these further - that is&#xD;
    the task of subsequent system or software development efforts.&#xD;
