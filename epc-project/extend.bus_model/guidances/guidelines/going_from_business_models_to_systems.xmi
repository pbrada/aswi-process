&lt;p>&#xD;
    The approach to business modeling presented in the Rational Unified Process includes a concise and straightforward way&#xD;
    to generate requirements for supporting business tools or systems. A good understanding of business processes is&#xD;
    important for building the right systems. Even more value is added if you use people's roles and responsibilities, as&#xD;
    well as definitions of what &quot;things&quot; are handled by the business as a basis for building the system. It's from this&#xD;
    more internal view of the business, captured in a business analysis model, that you can see the tightest link to what&#xD;
    the models of the system needs to look like.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;

    The relation between models of the business and models of a supporting information system&#xD;

    name=&quot;Business Models and System Architecture&quot;>Business Models and System Architecture&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    From an architectural perspective, having business models in place is particularly useful if your intent is to build&#xD;
    one of the following kinds of systems:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Customized systems for one or more companies in a particular type of industry, such as banks and insurance&#xD;
        companies.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A family of applications for the open market, such as order handling systems, billing systems, and air-traffic&#xD;
        control systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business models give input to the use-case view and the logical view as presented in the analysis model. You can&#xD;
    also find key mechanisms at the analysis level, which are referred to as analysis mechanisms.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following should be considered:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For each business use case that will be supported by the system, identify a subsystem in the analysis model. This&#xD;
        subsystem is in the application layer and is considered a first prototype iteration. For example, if you have an&#xD;
        Order process and a Billing process in your business use-case model, identify an Order subsystem and a Billing&#xD;
        subsystem in the application layer of your analysis model. You may argue that Order and Billing are separate&#xD;
        systems. Well, that's a matter of scope. If &lt;span&#xD;
        style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-FAMILY: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA&quot;>you're&lt;/span>&#xD;
        considering all of your business tools as one system with several applications that share architecture, Order and&#xD;
        Billing would be application subsystems. If your scope is to build an Order Management application only, then Order&#xD;
        Management would be your system and the recommendation above would not make sense. It only makes sense if your&#xD;
        scope is such that you consider all business tools in your organization as one system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For each business worker supported by the system, identify use cases that represent what is to be automated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For each business entity supported by the system, identify entity classes in the analysis model. Some of these are&#xD;
        candidates for being considered as key mechanisms, the component entities, in the system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        For clusters of business entities-a group of business entities that are used solely within one business use case or&#xD;
        a group of otherwise closely related business entities-create a subsystem in the business specific layer.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;340&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/co_bmarc.gif&quot; width=&quot;465&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    In a four-layered system architecture, business models give input to the top two layers&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_business_models__actors_to_the_system,_relationship_to&quot;&#xD;

    id=&quot;Business Models and Actors to the System&quot; name=&quot;Business Models and Actors to the System&quot;>Business Models and&#xD;
    Actors to the System&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bmtose1.gif&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    For each business worker, identify a candidate system actor. For each business use case the business worker&#xD;
    participates in, create a candidate system use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To identify information-system use cases, begin with the business workers in the business analysis model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each business worker, perform the following steps:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Decide if the business worker will be a person that will use the information system.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If so, identify an actor for the business worker in the information system's use-case model. Start by creating an&#xD;
        actor with the same name as the business worker.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Repeat these steps for all business workers.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each business use case realization, perform the following steps:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify those sequences of steps that are initiated by a system actor (as identified in the previous steps).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Create a system use case for each sequence of steps. Start by using the initiating step name (operation name) as&#xD;
        the use case name.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the system use case meets all the criteria for a system use case (provides meaningful value to the&#xD;
        actor and so on). Merge or further divide system use cases as appropriate.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that this is just a starting point for the system's use-case model. As the requirements from the system's&#xD;
    perspective are better understood, these initial system actors and use cases will be refactored as needed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;exampleheading&quot;>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    The figure below gives an example on how to derive the system use case for the &quot;Apply for a loan&quot; business use case&#xD;
    realization. The dotted lines in the figure mark the boundaries of the system that will be considered.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bmtosex1.gif&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Based on business models of a bank, you can derive candidate system actors and system use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_entity_class__business_models_relationships_to&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;XE_entity_class__business_models_relationships_to&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a id=&quot;Automated Business Worker&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Automated Business Worker&quot;>Automated Business Workers&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are aiming at building a system that completely automates a set of business processes-which is the case if you&#xD;
    are building an e-commerce application-for example, it's no longer the business worker who will become the system&#xD;
    actor. Instead, it's the business actor who will directly communicate with the system and act as a system actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You are, in effect, changing the way business is performed when building an application of this kind. Responsibilities&#xD;
    of the business worker will be moved to the business actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;exampleheading&quot;>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    When building an e-commerce site for a bank, you will be modifying the way the process is realized.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Responsibilities of the Clerk will be moved to the Customer.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Create a system actor Customer corresponding to the business actor Customer.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            The Clerk and the Loan System business workers will be merged to become the Enhanced Loan System business&#xD;
            worker (this is represented in the figure below by the dotted lines).&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Modify the business use case realization in accordance to this new business worker.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            Identify the new system use cases, or adapt the existing ones, based on the modified business use case&#xD;
            realization. Usually operations between merged business workers become steps in the new/updated system use&#xD;
            case(s).&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bmtosex2.gif&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    Completely automating business workers changes the way the business process is realized, as well as how you find system&#xD;
    actors and use cases&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    For each business entity, create a class in the system's analysis model&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business entity to be managed by an information system will correspond to an entity in the analysis model of the&#xD;
    information system. In some cases, however, it might be suitable to let attributes of the business entity correspond to&#xD;
    entities in the information-system model. Several business workers can access a business entity. Consequently, the&#xD;
    corresponding entities in the system can participate in several information-system use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;exampleheading&quot;>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bmtosex3.gif&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    The business entities Customer Profile, Account, and Loan are all candidates for automation.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;

    id=&quot;Business Events&quot; name=&quot;Business Events&quot;>Business Events&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business events identify important occurrences or changes of state in the business. They are used to decouple business&#xD;
    use cases and send notifications or triggers about the occurrence or change in state. As such, they are an excellent&#xD;
    source for business process automation, to reduce interactions between business workers and speed up business use&#xD;
    cases. Automating business events allows for the rapid propagation of important information throughout the business,&#xD;
    without burdening business workers with this responsibility.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    For example, all units involved in a military operation, may need to be notified immediately in the event of a&#xD;
    strategic vantage point being claimed by friendly (or hostile) forces. Without automation, this business may be&#xD;
    implemented by broadcasting a codeword (such as &lt;b>Top Hat&lt;/b>) on a specific radio frequency. It would be left up to&#xD;
    all receivers of the codeword to take the necessary action (such as proceeding into the next phase of battle).&#xD;
    Automating this business event would allow for more efficient notification of the event, as well as possibly automating&#xD;
    the different responses to the event as well.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    How should you interpret a link between workers in the business model? You must find out how the information systems&#xD;
    can support the communicating workers. An information system can eliminate the need to transport information between&#xD;
    workers by making the information available in the information system.&#xD;

    Planning&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you intend to use the business analysis model for resource planning or as a basis for simulation, you will need to&#xD;
    update it to reflect what types of resources are used. You need to modify it so that each business worker and business&#xD;
    entity is implemented by only one type of resource. If your aim is to re-engineer the business process, in the first&#xD;
    iteration of your business analysis model, you should not consider resources. Doing so tends to make you focus on the&#xD;
    already existing solutions, rather than on identifying problems that can be solved with new kinds of solutions. Here's&#xD;
    an example of a procedure to consider:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In a first iteration of the business analysis model, work without considering the resources or the systems that&#xD;
        will be used to implement the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Discuss what can be automated.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Discuss how automation can change the business process and start sketching out a system use-case model and system&#xD;
        requirements.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        In a second iteration to the business analysis model, update it to reflect resources used and what is to be&#xD;
        automated. &#xD;
        &lt;ul>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Some business workers will be tagged as automated workers.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Some business workers will be split into two-one automated, the other one not.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Parts of two business workers may be partitioned out to a new automated worker.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Parts of a business &lt;span&#xD;

                responsibility&lt;/span> may be moved outside of the organization to become the responsibility of a business&#xD;
                actor.&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;exampleheading&quot;>&#xD;
            Example:&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    In the banking example, we decided to update the business analysis model in order to use it for resource planning.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            The Clerk business worker is completely automated and becomes an Automated Clerk. The bank will only do on-line&#xD;
            banking.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
            The Loan Specialist is partly automated, and is split into an Automated Loan Specialist and a Loan Specialist.&#xD;
        &lt;/p>&#xD;
