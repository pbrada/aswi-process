    The main purpose of collecting information is to develop an understanding of the problems and potentials of the&#xD;
    existing business and its environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To understand where the problems are, the needs of the customers, the experiences of the employees, the intentions of&#xD;
    the owners as well as the market trends often need to be understood. There are a number of ways to collect this kind of&#xD;
    information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Depending on the character of the project, one, several or all of the following tasks can performed:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assess the business strategy to align the vision and the strategy.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Benchmark against other organizations to develop goals, objectives and innovative ideas.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand the customer?s demands to involve your customers in the business-modeling effort.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Understand the existing business to analyze what the problems are.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Measure the performance of the existing business to establish a starting point.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Study new technologies to build a good understanding of state-of-the-art solutions, generally as well as within&#xD;
        your own business area in order to find profitable process designs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Information collection is best done in small groups, so divide the tasks among members of the business-modeling team.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If the current business processes are not well understood, you may need to describe the current organization in&#xD;
    parallel.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If business modeling is done to reengineer and existing organization, a business? management team should be responsible&#xD;
    for formulating a directive, or enabling it to be formulated. Management is also responsible for communicating the need&#xD;
    for business modeling to both the people in the business-modeling team, and to all employees of the organization. It is&#xD;
    vital that management does this if the business-modeling project is to succeed.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A company's business idea identifies the products and services the company wants to offer and the markets where this&#xD;
    should take place. A business strategy defines the principles for how this should be accomplished and which the&#xD;
    long-term goals should be.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The business strategy must of course be in line with the way the business works. The strategy must embody the business'&#xD;
    long-term goals, and align the business use cases with those goals. As [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>DVP93&lt;/a>] points out,&#xD;
    &quot;Strategy and process objectives must reinforce one another and echo similar themes.&quot;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good business use case follows the direction of the strategy; a good strategy enables good business use cases. It is&#xD;
    especially important that you base your business modeling work on a strategy that is fully communicated and accepted&#xD;
    throughout the business. A well communicated, well-understood strategy simplifies the business-modeling work. On this&#xD;
    basis, the business-modeling team can arrive at a good design and explain its motivation. [&lt;a&#xD;

    modeling:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A strategy should not be based solely on financial goals. In general, employees tend not to perceive financial&#xD;
        goals as being sufficiently concrete, because it is not apparent to them how they can attain the goals&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A strategy should be formulated so its effects can be measured. A change in lead time is measurable, as is customer&#xD;
        satisfaction, and so on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A strategy should focus on a limited and realistic business idea.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A strategy should inspire, not force, employees at every level to create a business that realizes the desired&#xD;
        goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    Benchmarking is an technique to analyze information about, and exchange knowledge with, other businesses. Benchmarking&#xD;
    is designed to help you:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Know how other businesses perform.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Base your new goals on the goals of comparable businesses.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Validate that your own use-case goals surpass those of your competitors.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Learn innovations from other businesses.&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Benchmark businesses that:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have a good reputation.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Give thorough customer satisfaction.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Yield high-quality results.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are recognized leaders in the field.&#xD;

    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Are interested in benchmarking.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Benchmarking is often performed as a joint task with another business, with which you share information. Because it can&#xD;
    often be difficult to find competitors that want to benchmark, try approaching companies that operate in completely&#xD;
    different business areas. Look for analogous tasks in the other businesses?this often reveals innovative ideas about&#xD;
    how to work.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Benchmark metrics?about the business itself and about the resulting products and services of interest. Relevant metrics&#xD;
    are often a combination of time, cost and quality. You should also benchmark innovations, to get ideas on how you can&#xD;
    achieve your new goals. For example, by looking for similarities, a software company can probably learn a lot about&#xD;
    project management from a construction company.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several ways to gather information about other businesses:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Visit them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Have telephone discussions with their executives and consultants.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Consult publications.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Study the published case studies, which often can be found in academic publications.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is important that you contact the benchmarked businesses. Do not trust everything you read; some facts may have been&#xD;
    omitted from a published report. You may even find that the happy ending described in a report never happened.&#xD;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    You measure the existing business by measuring its business use cases. To do this, first define metrics for the&#xD;
    business use cases, then measure the business use cases. Selecting metrics and measures for a business use case is key&#xD;
    to understanding the business use case. As [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>HAR91&lt;/a>] put it: &quot;If&#xD;
    you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot manage it. If you cannot manage it,&#xD;
    you cannot improve it. It is as simple as that.&quot;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can measure the business by observing it from the outside (external metrics), or by measuring tasks inside the&#xD;
    business (internal metrics). External metrics relates to business use cases and usability, while internal metrics&#xD;
    concerns to the realization of business use cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Metrics can also be classified as either objective or subjective:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Objective metrics record the performance of the business. For example, the time it takes to perform a task, the&#xD;
        cost to produce something, or the number of errors in a product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Subjective metrics record people?s opinions. For example, how customers rate their satisfaction on a scale from 1&#xD;
        to 5, or if they would recommend the product to a friend.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that there are many things that cannot be measured easily, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Effect of training and education.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

    Cases&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A good combination of metrics usually includes objective and subjective metrics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective metrics should be a combination of time, cost and quality metrics. In our experience, a focus on the&#xD;
    optimization of a business use case?s time parameters (such as lead time) usually results in automatic improvements in&#xD;
    both cost and quality parameters.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The subjective metrics should focus on customer satisfaction. When you define subjective metrics, remember that what&#xD;
    counts is how the customer perceives the performance of the business. Subjective metrics should measure the performance&#xD;
    of the business as perceived from the outside.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Avoid internal metrics?use them only if they are clearly derived from external ones.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As you define the metrics for a use case, ask yourself:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Can they be measured? If not, remove them or change them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do they measure each use case from the perspectives of time, cost and quality?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Do they emphasize the outside perceptions of the business?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Measure the business use cases in the current target organization according to the metrics you have defined. Be sure to&#xD;
    collect the measurements from the people in the business that really knows the answers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Later, you will compare these collected values with the values of the modified business use cases. For example, if&#xD;
    shorter lead time is an objective for a new business use case, be sure you can verify that this objective has been&#xD;
    satisfied.&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;Walk through&quot; each kind of customer?s &quot;lifecycle,&quot; to see how he interacts with the business. Start with the&#xD;
    customer?s first contact with the business. Does the customer interact with many different people in the business? Does&#xD;
    the customer have to wait for answers, deliveries, and so on?&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Task in a Business Use-Case Workflow&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &quot;Walk through&quot; each use-case workflow and classify each task as value adding (VA) or non-value adding (NVA). A VA task&#xD;
    increases the value of the final product, from the customer?s perspective; an NVA task does not. Examples of NVA are&#xD;
    reviews, writing reports, moving information or resources within the business. Each NVA task is a candidate for removal&#xD;
    or minimization. Analyze each NVA task to identify the real reason why it is being performed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If time is critical you can analyze how time is spent in each business use case. For each task note the total time and&#xD;
    the waiting time. Analyze each task to see if time can be reduced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If cost is critical you can analyze the cost of each business use case. Note the cost of each task. The cost is often&#xD;
    directly related to the amount of work that is spent on the task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    On the basis of the values used to measure the existing business use cases, together with the benchmark metrics, you&#xD;
    can identify the business use case?s problems and limitations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To understand the problems you find, you probably need to talk to the people involved in the business use cases under&#xD;
    investigation. The aim is to gain insight into the problems and to elicit suggestions for improvements. If you have&#xD;
    succeeded in motivating the employees to do the business-modeling work, they will respond by contributing valuable&#xD;
    information and creative ideas.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Investigate the possibility of making short-term &lt;b>rationalization improvements&lt;/b> to the existing business use case.&#xD;
    Short-term improvements show the employees that progress is being made early in the business-modeling work, which helps&#xD;
    keep them motivated. Short-term improvements must be easy to implement and produce the results quickly. The staff can&#xD;
    regard even small changes to the daily routine as very positive. In addition, by understanding the simple things that&#xD;
    can improve the existing business, you will be better able to evaluate the more radical rationalization suggestions.&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine the existing business tools, with respect to both software and hardware. Describe how business tools&#xD;
    optimizes the work, and discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of their use.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Investigate if greater effectiveness can be achieved by expanding or modifying the parts of the business use cases that&#xD;
    are implemented using business tools. Be aware that old information systems can render an organization permanently&#xD;
    hierarchical. Sometimes it is simply impossible to engineer a business without constructing a completely new&#xD;
    information systems. At the same time, it is important to realize that it might be impossible to throw out, in one&#xD;
    step, a system in which the business has invested a great deal of money.&#xD;

&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make an inventory of knowledge and special skills areas. This is important in order to understand the additional skills&#xD;
    that will be required by the personnel of the new business. Look at the roles key personnel play in the existing&#xD;
    business and determine how to spread this knowledge, possibly dividing the work tasks among several people. All&#xD;
    businesses have key people?individuals who drive development or have unique knowledge about the business? products. But&#xD;
    it is dangerous to be too dependent on a few individuals. The business cannot in any way guarantee the availability of&#xD;
    these people in the capacity required?if they fall ill or leave the business, it could be a catastrophe.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Requirements for Future Changes&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to determine the requirements for future changes in the business use case that might arise from the environment.&#xD;
    This can result in changes in the existing business use cases, but may also show that the business must be able to&#xD;
    offer completely new business use cases, whose requirements have not previously been envisaged. A competitive situation&#xD;
    may require this; either because competitors are already offering certain services that customers are now demanding, or&#xD;
    because the business has identified a new way of increasing its competitiveness. In the first case, it means launching&#xD;
    something that is seen as being at least as good as the competitor?s product. In the second case, the business is in a&#xD;
    much better position, being one step ahead of the competition.&#xD;
