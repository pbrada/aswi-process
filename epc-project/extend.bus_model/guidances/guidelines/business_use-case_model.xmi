&lt;p>&#xD;
    A primary purpose of modeling business use cases and actors is to describe how the business is used by external&#xD;
    agencies, importantly, its customers and partners. Tasks that directly concern the customer or partner, as well as&#xD;
    supporting or managerial tasks that only indirectly concern the external party, can be presented.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The model describes the business in terms of business use cases, which correspond to what are generally called&#xD;
    &quot;processes&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Business Use Cases&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When looking at the tasks in a business, you will be able to identify at least three categories of work corresponding&#xD;
    to three categories of business use cases:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Core&lt;/b>-These are external-facing business use cases that provide the value chain-for example, Buy Product.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Management&lt;/b>-These are internal business use cases that coordinate the value chain-for example, Strategic&#xD;
        Planning.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Support&lt;/b>-These are internal business use cases that support the value chain-for example, Procure Raw&#xD;
        Materials.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We elaborate later on the meaning and representation of &lt;a href=&quot;#IntBusUC&quot;>'internal business use case'&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically, a management type of business use case describes, in general, the relationships between the CEO and the&#xD;
    people who work in the business use cases. It also describes how business use cases are developed and instantiated&#xD;
    (started).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bucm2.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot;>&#xD;
    In this illustration, at a restaurant, the core business use cases are marketing and serving dinner, and the supporting&#xD;
    business use case is purchasing supplies.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that what you regard as a core business use case can sometimes be a supporting business use case in another&#xD;
    business. For example, software development is a core business use case in a software development company, but it would&#xD;
    be classified as a supporting business use case in a bank or an insurance company. Note though that many detailed&#xD;
    business use cases that would be developed if you were modeling a software development business, will not appear at the&#xD;
    topmost business use case level for a bank, say, that happens to develop its own software, not even as supporting&#xD;
    business use cases. They may appear later as subordinate use cases (see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/modeling_large_organizations_DB7556B6.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;1.268342166757605E-304&quot;>Concept: Modeling Large Organizations&lt;/a>). At the level of the bank, you would expect&#xD;
    only to see supporting use cases that reflect the &lt;em>strategy&lt;/em> and &lt;em>goals&lt;/em> of the bank - one of which might&#xD;
    well be 'operate software development business unit'.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;A Business has Many Business Use Cases&quot; name=&quot;A Business has Many Business Use Cases&quot;>A Business Has Many&#xD;
    Business Use Cases&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Instances of several different business use cases, as well as several instances of a single business use case, normally&#xD;
    execute in parallel. There might be an almost unlimited number of paths a use-case instance can follow. These different&#xD;
    paths represent the choices open to the use-case instance in the workflow description. Depending on specific events or&#xD;
    facts, a use-case instance can proceed along one of several possible paths, directed, for example by:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        input from an actor&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a business rule&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In modeling business use cases, you can assume that use-case instances can be active concurrently without conflicting.&#xD;
    At this stage of business development, you should focus on &lt;b>what&lt;/b> the business should do. Solve potential resource&#xD;
    conflicts later, when modeling the business use-case realizations, at which stage you try to understand &lt;b>how&lt;/b>&#xD;
    things should work in the business. Or you might solve these problems during the implementation of the new&#xD;
    organization, for example,&amp;nbsp;by increasing the number of employees who can perform the critical task.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Are Business Use Cases Always Related to Actors?&quot; name=&quot;Are Business Use Cases Always Related to Actors?&quot;>Are&#xD;
    Business Use Cases Always Related to Business Actors?&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Every core business use case must have a communicates-relationship to or from a business actor. This rule enforces the&#xD;
    goal that businesses must be built around the services that their users request. If your Business Use-Case Model has&#xD;
    core business use cases that no one requests, this should warn you that something is wrong with the model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business use cases can be triggered periodically, or they can run for a very long time; a surveillance function is an&#xD;
    example of the latter. Even these business use cases have business actors that originally initiated them and expect&#xD;
    different services from them. Otherwise they would not be part of the business. Other business use cases produce&#xD;
    results for a business actor, although they are not explicitly initiated by the business actor. For example, the&#xD;
    development of a widely distributed product is seldom initiated by an identifiable customer. Instead, the need for a&#xD;
    new product is realized from market studies and the accumulated requests of many users.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;IntBusUC&quot; name=&quot;IntBusUC&quot;>Internal Business Use Cases&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Management and supporting business use cases (which we described above as internal) do not necessarily need to connect&#xD;
    to a business actor, although they normally have some kind of external contact. A management business use case, for&#xD;
    instance, might have the business owners or the board as its business actor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now, a business use case without an actor seems an odd thing, given that a 'use case' is supposed to represent&#xD;
    someone's or something's interaction with the business, and is supposed to deliver value, but you can regard this class&#xD;
    of business use case as &lt;em>extensions&lt;/em> of, perhaps notional, business use cases that do have business actors. We&#xD;
    discuss the use of explicit extension in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/extend-relationship_in_the_business_use-case_model_17CD0314.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;3.452362968952187E-305&quot;>Guideline: Extend-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model&lt;/a>, but here the base&#xD;
    (extended) business use case may be conceptual, and you may choose not to model it.&amp;nbsp;The management and supporting&#xD;
    business use cases are then extensions to this conceptual base, triggered by conditions (resulting in &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_event_853992A0.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{EF5798CC-41AE-4137-B248-B308D465CF8A}&quot;>Artifact: Business Event&lt;/a>s) that arise in the conduct of business.&#xD;
    Thinking in this way removes the need for artificial business actors to be introduced, but does oblige you to think&#xD;
    about how the supporting and management business use cases add value.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Abstract business use cases do not need a business actor, because they are never instantiated (started) on their own.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Business Use Cases Should Support Business Goals&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Business Use Cases Should Support Business Goals&quot;>Business Use Cases Must Support Business Goals&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business processes are the vehicle with which the business does things. Because business strategy is very difficult to&#xD;
    translate directly into actions, something is else is needed. This something else is business goals, which ensure that&#xD;
    business processes execute the business strategy by steering actions at all levels of the organization towards the&#xD;
    ultimate business goal-the business idea.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For this reason, each business use case should support at least one business goal. Translating the strategy into goals&#xD;
    at different levels provides concrete, measurable objectives, which can be directly supported by business processes.&#xD;
    Defining supporting relationships between goals and processes ensures that the business processes are aligned with the&#xD;
    business strategy. This also helps find the right level of business use cases, which is often difficult to determine.&#xD;
    Only one business use case (for example, Make Profit) that directly supports the strategic goals of the enterprise&#xD;
    would be too complex and cumbersome to model as a sequence of tasks. On the other hand, a separate business use case&#xD;
    for each individual operational task in the organization (for example, Forward Telephone Call or Book Conference Room)&#xD;
    would result in too many business use cases to understand. Defining the business goals supported by a business use case&#xD;
    indicates whether the business use case is &quot;too high&quot; or &quot;too low.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a business use case explicitly supports one or more business goals, it becomes easier to quantify the value of the&#xD;
    business use case. The contribution of the result of the business use case toward the goal can be measured. The&#xD;
    performance of the business use case also can be monitored to provide an objective comparison of value versus cost.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The existence of these relationships helps in prioritizing business use cases. Business use cases that support many&#xD;
    business goals, or important and risky ones, are most likely to be considered architecturally significant. Many goals&#xD;
    might also point to unnecessary complexity. If one business use case supports many different goals, then it is quite&#xD;
    likely that conflicts will arise. In these cases, it may not be clear which goals should preside, resulting in&#xD;
    inefficient actions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The category of the business use case (core, supporting, or management) does not directly determine the types of&#xD;
    business goals it supports. The category provides only a guideline: the business strategy will ultimately determine&#xD;
    which business goals a particular business use case supports. For example, a Market and Sell Product business use case&#xD;
    might support the Competitive Prices business goal for a business with an aggressive growth strategy. The same&#xD;
    business, years later, may wish to maximize its investment in these products and markets by targeting customer&#xD;
    satisfaction and retention. The Market and Sell Product business use case may then have to support the (very different)&#xD;
    Superior Quality business goal. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_goal_CCCB68FF.html&quot; guid=&quot;9.06687347922131E-306&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business Goal&lt;/a> for more information on modeling business goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For example, consider the large furniture store used as an example in &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_goal_CCCB68FF.html&quot; guid=&quot;9.06687347922131E-306&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Business Goal&lt;/a>. A Business Use Case Model for such a furniture chain may look as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram shows Business Use Case Model for furniture stores.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bucm5.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The customer can select products, pick them up from the warehouse attached to the showroom, and pay for them. Defect&#xD;
    products can be returned. Identify Customer Needs is the business use case that is often referred to as Market&#xD;
    Research. Once a suitable product has been found, it is launched, and the Vendor then becomes a Supplier. Product sales&#xD;
    must be monitored, although it is arguable whether this a separate business use case (shown in the figure above) or&#xD;
    part of Market Research. If we were to map the above business use cases onto the business goals described in &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/business_goal_CCCB68FF.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;9.06687347922131E-306&quot;>Guideline: Business Goal&lt;/a>, the following could result:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bucm6.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    The Find Suitable Product business use case supports somewhat conflicting business goals. It must be made clear how to&#xD;
    make tradeoffs between price and quality to ensure that both business goals are met. If product quality is measured by&#xD;
    the number (or percentage) of returned defects, the cause of the defect must be established to trace it back to the&#xD;
    supplier. For example, it could be that many products delivered to customers are returned due to the fact that they are&#xD;
    damaged by the delivery team. However, if only the number of deliveries is measured, the quality of deliveries is not&#xD;
    revealed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    The Pay for Product business use case may support Payment Method and not Low Pricing, because pricing is determined&#xD;
    during the (separate) Find Suitable Product Business use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    In some companies, a number of business use cases support no business goals. This may be a reason to merge Monitor&#xD;
    Sales, for example, into Identify Customer Need, because Monitor Sales does not directly support any business goals.&#xD;
    However, such merging should not be done too hastily, because a lack of support for business goals can be a sign that&#xD;
    the business goals need to made more concrete. In the worst case, Monitor Sales provides input to Identify Customer&#xD;
    Needs.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    The Deliver Product business use case supports the Delivery Time business goal. Customers should not have to wait too&#xD;
    long for their purchased products to be delivered. Considering how this goal can be achieved might provide radical new&#xD;
    ideas. For example, an underground tube could connect the warehouse to houses in the city and products could be blasted&#xD;
    at 100 MPH through the tubes to arrive at home before the customer does! While this is unrealistic, this kind of&#xD;
    brainstorming often generates many ideas for improving the business.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    Here is an example of how considering business goals may reveal the importance of seemingly trivial business use cases.&#xD;
    Suppose it appears that many customers shop during mealtimes. Because one of the business goals is to improve the&#xD;
    quality of facilities and another is to attract customers, we may decide to provide a restaurant where customers can&#xD;
    have a snack before or after shopping. The business use case that supports this goal, Have Meal, is shown below. It may&#xD;
    turn out that the restaurant becomes one of the main attractions of the business!&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/bucm7.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    We also see the effect of adjusting the boundary of the business in the diagram above. Here, a new business actor has&#xD;
    been introduced-namely, Shipper, a partner responsible for picking products up at the warehouse and delivering them to&#xD;
    customers. It could be that this approach allows us to minimize the delivery time, which is one of the business goals.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Structuring the Business Use-Case Model&quot; name=&quot;Structuring the Business Use-Case Model&quot;>Structuring the Business&#xD;
    Use-Case Model&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are three main reasons for structuring the Business Use-Case Model:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        make the business use cases easier to understand&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        reuse parts of workflows that are shared among many business use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        make the Business Use-Case Model easier to maintain&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To structure the business use cases, we have three kinds of relationships. You will use these relationships to factor&#xD;
    out pieces of business use cases that can be reused in other business use cases, or that are specializations or options&#xD;
    to the business use case. The business use case that represents the modification is called the &lt;b>addition use&#xD;
    case&lt;/b>. The business use case that is modified is called the &lt;b>base use case&lt;/b>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If there is a part of a base use case that represents a function of which the business use case only depends on the&#xD;
        result, not the method used to produce the result, you can factor that part out to an addition use case. The&#xD;
        addition is explicitly included in the base use case, using the include-relationship. See also &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/include-relationship_in_the_business_use-case_model_F3DC3A5B.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;8.096716256124967E-305&quot;>Guideline: Include-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model&lt;/a>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If there is a part of a base use case that is optional, or not necessary to understand the primary purpose of the&#xD;
        use case, you can factor that part out to an addition use case in order to simplify the structure of the base use&#xD;
        case. The addition is implicitly included in the base use case, using the extend-relationship. See also &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../extend.bus_model/guidances/guidelines/extend-relationship_in_the_business_use-case_model_17CD0314.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;3.452362968952187E-305&quot;>Guideline: Extend-Relationship in the Business Use-Case Model&lt;/a>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        If there are business use cases that have commonalities in behavior and structure and that have similarities in&#xD;
        purpose, their common parts can be factored out to a base use case (parent) that is inherited by addition use cases&#xD;
        (children). The child use cases can insert new behavior and modify existing behavior in the structure they inherit&#xD;
        from the parent use case. See also &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

    The figure above shows actors and use cases and the check-in counter. Here we also show the inclusion use case Baggage&#xD;
    Handling and the extension use case Through Check-In.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You can use actor-generalization to show how actors are specializations of one another. See also &lt;a&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Especially when developing business models just to &quot;prime the pump&quot; for a software engineering project, you must&#xD;
    carefully delimit the business-modeling effort. In this case, it is rarely worthwhile to span the whole organization,&#xD;
    even if you model only a subset of the business processes. To stay focused and produce results that are of the expected&#xD;
    value, you should consider a part of the whole company as your &quot;business system.&quot; The part you choose should be the&#xD;
    part that might directly use the system to be built. The parts of the organization that you decide to treat as external&#xD;
    to the model can be represented as business actors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;exampleheading&quot;>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    The company has decided to undertake an effort to build a new application for sales and order management. To explore&#xD;
    the needs of the organization and also to align the way business is done throughout the organization, the first step is&#xD;
    to build a set of business models. The departments of the company that will not actively use the new order application&#xD;
    are considered external to the model and are represented with business actors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    The figure above shows business actors and business use cases in a Business Use-Case Model of an order management&#xD;
    organization. This organization sells complex solutions, custom-made to each customer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    Here are some brief descriptions of the business use cases:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Order Process-&lt;/b>This process describes how the company takes appropriate actions to deliver a solution to a&#xD;
    customer as defined by a set of customer requirements. The process starts when there is a business decision to proceed&#xD;
    with an agreed-upon solution. This may often be in the form of the company receiving a purchase order from a customer.&#xD;
    It ends when the customer is satisfied with the installment, and commission of the solution and payment is received.&#xD;
    The objective is to satisfy customer requirements in a profitable way.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Proposal Process-&lt;/b>This is the process of generating a proposal(s) in response to customer requirements. The&#xD;
    process is triggered by an inquiry from a customer and ends when the customer accepts (or rejects) any of the quote(s)&#xD;
    in the proposal. The objective is to reach agreement on a quote that is acceptable both to the customer and to the&#xD;
    company.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Quote Process-&lt;/b>The Quote Process is an abstract business use case that is included in both the Proposal Process&#xD;
    and the Order Process. The process begins when there are customer requirements that need a quote produced for it. The&#xD;
    objective of the Quote Process is to produce a solution meeting the customer requirements, and to provide it along with&#xD;
    a price.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A survey description of the Business Use-Case Model must:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        summarize the purpose of the organization&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        point out delimitations of the model-things that are not included and the reasons why&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        specify the primary business use cases&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;exampleheading&quot;>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    This Business Use-Case Model covers the part of our company that manages orders from our customers, since only this&#xD;
    part is of interest to the software engineering project that will use the results of business modeling as an input. For&#xD;
    this reason, we do not include the parts of the company that handles billing, manufacturing, product management, and&#xD;
    product development; they are considered external and therefore represented as business actors.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    In this organization, a sale involves not just the agreement on a solution, but also the actual building of the&#xD;
    solution. To define a price for a solution, you need to engineer and build it to a certain level of detail. That is&#xD;
    what is done in the Proposal Process. Once an agreement has been made with the customer, the solution is engineered in&#xD;
    all details and then installed at the customer site. This is what is described in the Order Process. Both the Proposal&#xD;
    Process and the Order Process include the abstract business use case Quote Process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;XE_business_use-case_model__characteristics_of_a_good&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;XE_business_use-case_model__characteristics_of_a_good&quot;>&lt;/a>&lt;a&#xD;
    id=&quot;Characteristics of a Good Business Use-Case Model&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;Characteristics of a Good Business Use-Case Model&quot;>Characteristics of a Good Business Use-Case Model&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business use cases are aligned with the business strategy, as described by concrete business goals.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Use cases conform to the business they describe.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        All use cases are found. Taken together, use cases perform all tasks within the business.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Every task within the business should be included in at least one use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There should be a balance between the number of use cases and the size of the use cases:&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;ul>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Few use cases make the model easier to understand.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Many use cases may make the model difficult to understand.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Large use cases may be complex and difficult to understand.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;li>&#xD;
            Small use cases are often easy to understand. However, make sure that the use case describes a complete&#xD;
            workflow that produces something of value for a customer.&#xD;
        &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Each use case must be unique. If the workflow is the same as or similar to another use case, it will be difficult&#xD;
        to keep them synchronized later. Consider merging them into a single use case.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The survey description of the Business Use-Case Model should give a good, comprehensive picture of the&#xD;
        organization.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></mainDescription>
