    An association represents structural relationships between instances of business workers and business entities in the&#xD;
    business analysis model. It is information that must be preserved for some duration, and does not simply show&#xD;
    procedural dependency relationships. Each association has a name and a multiplicity. The multiplicity defines how many&#xD;
    objects of the connected class can be connected. It is either a constant or a range (e.g., 0..5) that shows the number&#xD;
    of objects that can be connected.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h5>&#xD;
    Example:&#xD;
&lt;/h5>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    An agent who checks in airline passengers follows a set of instructions that describe his tasks in the check-in&#xD;
    business use case. Each employee acting as a check-in agent should know these procedures by heart, in order for the&#xD;
    check-in use case to work smoothly. The business worker class Check-in Agent should have an association to a business&#xD;
    entity class representing the set of instructions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Roles&quot; name=&quot;Roles&quot;>Roles&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some types of associations may have a rather broad interpretation. For these types, it is important that you specify&#xD;
    the particular interpretation in each case. For this purpose, the roles that involved parties play in the association&#xD;
    can be specified. If this is not sufficient to describe the association, the association can be given a name as well.&#xD;
    Avoid names like &quot;has&quot; and &quot;contains&quot; which do not add any information to what the association already indicates.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
