    Business Events represent the important things that happen in business and as such help manage complexity. Business&#xD;
    Events are triggered and received by Business Actors, Business Workers, and Business Entities, while interacting to&#xD;
    realize Business Use Cases. Business Events are used to trigger Business Use Cases, to signal changes of state of the&#xD;
    business, and to pass information between Business Use Cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholders and business-process analysts use Business Events to better understand and describe the activities of the&#xD;
    business. Business designers are responsible for identifying and detailing Business Events. Business Events are also&#xD;
    used by systems analysts to help identify software system actors and use cases, and by software architects to help make&#xD;
    software systems more flexible and maintainable.&#xD;

    Attributes are often useful to explicitly define what information is relevant. Operations can be used but are not&#xD;
    really useful during business modeling, and therefore are not often employed. Business Events are usually represented&#xD;
    in models of software systems. These software system representations of Business Events usually do have operations.&#xD;
