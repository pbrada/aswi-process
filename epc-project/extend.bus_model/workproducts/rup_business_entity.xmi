&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Entities represent an abstraction of important persistent information within the business. Any piece of&#xD;
    information that is a property of something else is probably not a Business Entity in itself.&amp;nbsp; For example,&#xD;
    ContactDetails is a property of Customer and therefore not a Business Entity in itself. Information that is not stored&#xD;
    but is created or determined on-demand (when necessary) is also probably not a Business Entity. For example, product&#xD;
    inventory is certainly significant information, but this is not persistent information. Anytime somebody needs to know&#xD;
    how many instances of a particular bar code are currently on the shelves (or in the warehouse), this information will&#xD;
    be calculated and then discarded.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Stakeholders use Business Entities to ensure that the information created and required by the organization is present&#xD;
    in the Business Analysis Model. A business designer is responsible for identifying and describing Business Entities, as&#xD;
    well as for assessing the impact of organizational changes on the information created and required by the business.&#xD;
    Business Entities are also used by systems analysts and designers when describing system use cases and identifying&#xD;
    software entities, respectively.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that we say that Business Entities are manipulated by Business Workers, and in Business Use Case Realizations we&#xD;
    show this through invocations of operations on the Business Entity by Business Workers. This depiction is itself a&#xD;
    convenience - in reality the operation invoked on the Business Entity may be through the application of a tool by the&#xD;
    Business Worker.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are doing domain modeling, meaning that you identify Business Entities only, you can use the stereotype&#xD;
    &amp;lt;&amp;lt;domain class&amp;gt;&amp;gt; instead of &amp;lt;&amp;lt;business entity&amp;gt;&amp;gt;.&#xD;
&lt;/p></representationOptions>
