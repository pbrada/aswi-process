&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of a Business System is to reduce and manage the complex web of interdependencies and interactions within a&#xD;
    business. This is done by defining a set of capabilities so that those dependent on these capabilities need have no&#xD;
    knowledge of how those capabilities are performed. In this way, Business Systems are used in much the same manner that&#xD;
    hardware and software components are used. They define a unit of structure that encapsulates the structural elements&#xD;
    that they contain and are characterized by their externally visible properties.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Systems are used by business-process analysts to determine whether the capabilities required within the&#xD;
    organization are present and to ensure that the business model is anticipating change or is at least resilient to&#xD;
    change. Business designers use Business Systems to form collections of related business workers and business entities&#xD;
    and explicitly define and manage dependencies within the organization. Project managers also use Business Systems for&#xD;
    scheduling work in parallel.&#xD;
&lt;/p></purpose>

    UML Representation:&amp;nbsp;component in the business analysis model, stereotyped as &amp;lt;&amp;lt;business system&amp;gt;&amp;gt;. A&#xD;
    business system is at the same scale as a UML subsystem and, because it is a component,&amp;nbsp;has packaging semantics as&#xD;
    well. The top-level component of the model &lt;em>is&lt;/em> the business or part of the business under consideration, and&#xD;
    appears in the context diagram in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Systems should be used to manage dependencies within the organization by explicitly defining the capabilities&#xD;
    (or services) that each Business System provides. This implies that the Business System encapsulates its contained&#xD;
    elements so that users of its services do not depend on &lt;b>how&lt;/b> it provides its services but rather on &lt;b>what&lt;/b>&#xD;
    services it provides.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This rule can be relaxed when encapsulation is not important. In this case, Business Systems may directly interact&#xD;
    with, or be dependent on elements contained within other Business Systems. Formally specifying in detail the notional&#xD;
    services that must be provided&amp;nbsp;at the Business System boundary is less important in this case because ultimately&#xD;
    those services belong with the elements contained in the Business System, and it is to services on those contained&#xD;
    elements that a service user will bind.&amp;nbsp;This variation regards the Business System&amp;nbsp;more as a packaging&#xD;
    (structuring) mechanism, rather than as a concept in itself.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When this is done, the business system essentially does not exist at execution time, that is, as the business operates,&#xD;
    because its notional services are provided directly by its contained elements. Even so, it may still indicate a real&#xD;
    business organizational boundary, with ownership of resources.&#xD;
