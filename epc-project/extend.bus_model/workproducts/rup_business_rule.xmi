&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this work product is to define a specific constraint or invariant that must be satisfied by the&#xD;
    business. Business Rules may apply always (in which case they are called invariants) or only under a specific&#xD;
    condition. If the condition occurs, the rule becomes valid, and must therefore be complied with.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Rules are reviewed by stakeholders, business-process analysts, and business designers to ensure that the&#xD;
    descriptions of the business conform to the way business is done.&amp;nbsp; They are also used by system analysts and&#xD;
    software architects when defining and designing software that supports the business.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Modeling of business rules is optional-they are often captured in document form in addition to or instead of a model.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business rules can be captured in both model and document form. Business rules defining structural and behavioral&#xD;
    constraints are most easily captured directly in models, attached to the model elements to which they apply. Other&#xD;
    business rules, especially those describing computations or policy, or those that apply to many different model&#xD;
    elements, are best captured in document form.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Business Rules can also be included in other business or requirements specification documents.&lt;br />&#xD;
