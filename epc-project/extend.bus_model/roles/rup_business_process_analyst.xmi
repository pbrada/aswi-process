&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a use-case approach is taken, the business process analyst leads and coordinates business use-case modeling by&#xD;
    outlining and delimiting the organization being modeled-for example, by establishing what business actors and business&#xD;
    use cases exist and how they interact.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    A person acting as business-process analyst must be a good facilitator and have excellent communication skills.&#xD;
    Knowledge of the business domain is essential for those acting in this role; however, it is not necessary for other&#xD;
    roles.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A business-process analyst should be prepared to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        assess the situation of the target organization where the project's end-product will be deployed&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        understand customer and user requirements, their strategies, and their goals&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        perform a cost/benefit analysis for any suggested changes in the target organization&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        discuss and support those who market and sell the end-product of the project&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></skills>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are some approaches to assigning this role:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assign the Business-Process Analyst and Business Architect (and sometimes Business Designer)&amp;nbsp;roles to the same&#xD;
        person. These roles interact a lot, so it can be more efficient to have a single person responsible for both roles.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assign the Business-Process Analyst and System Analyst roles to the same person - useful when the business context&#xD;
        needs to be understood, but the organization doesn't have existing Business-Process Analyst skills. Many common&#xD;
        skills exist between these roles. One concern is that this person may find it difficult to separate business needs&#xD;
        from possible solutions, as the System Analyst works with requirements for automated systems.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Assign the Business-Process Analyst and Test Analyst roles to the same person - useful where customers are actively&#xD;
        involved in the project definition and ongoing assessment. You might mix this with some more technically skilled&#xD;
        staff assigned solely to the Business-Process Analyst and Test Analyst roles.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul></assignmentApproaches>
