    This task uses Business Process Models as input and identifies a set of candidate services which are included in the&#xD;
    project service portfolio. These candidate services may yet require additional refinement, however the steps included&#xD;
    here provide an effective manner in which to produce an initial set of &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    In the discussion of business alignment of services in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/guidelines/service_CA5D991C.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.1757522381974088E-306&quot;>Guideline:&#xD;
    Service&lt;/a>, the connection between business models and service identification was discussed. In general, this approach&#xD;
    provides a very tight connection between business stakeholders/users and the IT organization implementing services by&#xD;
    allowing for service operations to directly support the tasks identified in process models. In general,&#xD;
    business-process models focus on tasks performed by roles and/or resources in an organization to accomplish some goal,&#xD;
    usually to provide value in the form of product or service to an external party such as a customer or partner. The&#xD;
    overall process is therefore an ordered set of such tasks, possibly decomposed into sub-processes. It has associated&#xD;
    organization, resource, and data models to capture all aspects of the process including not only performing roles, but&#xD;
    required/used resources, ownership of resources, accountability, definitions of items passed into and out of tasks, and&#xD;
    so on. The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/guidances/concepts/business_process_decomposition_C9A38841.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_vHtFUC7CEdu64PK-GeN94Q&quot;>Concept: Business Process Decomposition&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;describes how we reach a level of&#xD;
    description of a business process model at which it is possible to identify candidate services, as shown in the example&#xD;
    below.&amp;nbsp;Depending on the level of granularity of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/workproducts/rup_business_use_case_model_EC79264C.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{89BEF367-5875-47E0-97D6-23E5BCCE52B8}&quot;>Artifact: Business Use Case Model&lt;/a>, it may be necessary to &lt;em>&lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../extend.bus_model/tasks/refine_business_use_case_13E3A77B.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_NQD5oDOdEduwK5jZAAYgbw&quot;>refine the business use-cases&lt;/a>,&lt;/em> to be able to reach the level of decomposition&#xD;
    at which a useful process model can be produced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following demonstrates a very simple process model using the IBM WebSphere Business Integration Modeler.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;289&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram is described in the textual content.&quot; src=&quot;./resources/soa_svce_identification-03.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;687&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In this case, each horizontal swimlane represents a particular role performing tasks in the process. The process starts&#xD;
    with the green circle, ends with the red outlined circle, and does have data flowing between some tasks (in the form of&#xD;
    a loan request). This process, while obviously trivial and contrived, does demonstrate the high level of tasks. They&#xD;
    may be atomic actions from a business point of view, but obviously would require a number of steps when decomposed to&#xD;
    the IT level. In general, in object-oriented development of component based development, we would then treat each&#xD;
    individual task from the business view as a use case at the IT view and decompose into sets of components and classes&#xD;
    to form the implementation of the use case.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In a service-oriented solution, the service is identified at a similar level of granularity. It is commonly assumed&#xD;
    that the operations on a service specification will correspond 1:1 with the atomic tasks identified in a business&#xD;
    process model. While this is an attractive approach and may, if carefully done, achieve the right results, it also&#xD;
    tends to lead to the assumption that such once services are identified, they may be directly implemented as they are&#xD;
    described in the process model. Specifically each role (swimlane) will become a named service with each task within the&#xD;
    swimlane created as an operation on the corresponding service, as can be seen in the following diagram.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;76&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/soa_svce_identification-03b.gif&quot; width=&quot;731&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    What this approach fails to take into consideration is that there are non-functional requirements that affect the kind&#xD;
    of service to be developed, the way operations are identified on services, and so forth. The level of detail usually&#xD;
    captured by such tools tends not to include enough to capture security, quality of service, or manageability policies,&#xD;
    for example. By transforming the process into a set of &lt;i>candidate&lt;/i> service specifications in a service model&#xD;
    provides a starting point, but should be considered only as a starting point from which further analysis is performed&#xD;
    before the design model is developed which describes the actual implementation. Therefore all such services should have&#xD;
    their status set to 'candidate', as can be seen in this view of the Rational Software Modeler property view.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;176&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;./resources/soa_svce_identification-03c.gif&quot; width=&quot;578&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Alternative Representation&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where a more document-centric format for the service model is used it may be more appropriate to capture the mapping&#xD;
    between process tasks and service using a tabular form. The example below demonstrates this possible format.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
