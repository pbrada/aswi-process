  <mainDescription>A channel represents the communication path between two services. It is important to note that interaction may occur over a&#xD;
channel, but the channel does not represent any particular interaction. In the web services world, each service denotes the&#xD;
binding(s) associated with it (so that a client may access it). In a modeling profile, you denote binding either on the&#xD;
communication between services or between a service and consumers. In this way, you can be flexible in understanding the&#xD;
binding requirements. &lt;br /></mainDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The service channel provides the connection between two services or between a service and a client that allows for&#xD;
    communication. Consider the example of a dedicated telephone line between two parties; the connection is always there&#xD;
    even if it is not used and the connection is distinct from any conversation that takes place on it. When modeling&#xD;
    collaborations between services and specifically messages being sent between services, these take place over the&#xD;
    connection.&#xD;

    binding : String - Denotes the platform binding mechanism to use in generating the service binding in WSDL; examples&#xD;
    might be SOAP-RPC, SOAP-Doc, HTTP-Get, and so on. The actual set of binding values, or rather the text used on the&#xD;
    tagged value, available to use in a model is undefined by RUP and will vary by project.&lt;br />&#xD;
