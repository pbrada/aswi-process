&lt;p>&#xD;
    When designing &lt;i>&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../soa.rup_soma/workproducts/soa_svce_model_message_BE931590.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{DD9F96C3-4D00-4441-951E-2674B9AEE1C6}&quot;>Messages&lt;/a>&lt;/i>, there are occasionally structures that we find are&#xD;
    actually realized as documents or other compound and potentially large files. For example, reports or product&#xD;
    information may be distributed as PDF files or a message may have attached images describing a product or item. The&#xD;
    &lt;i>&lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../soa.rup_soma/guidances/whitepapers/uml_profile_for_software_services_7ADFB3D2.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;2.972928238097629E-306&quot;>Unified Modeling Language (UML) Profile for Software Services&lt;/a>&lt;/i> provides an&#xD;
    additional stereotype &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&lt;i>Message Attachment&lt;/i>&amp;gt;&amp;gt; which can be attached to properties in a message model&#xD;
    noting that the specified content is attached to the model in some way. This allows the designer to provide a detailed&#xD;
    specification of a very important aspect of message design. In particular, in respect to performance and bandwidth&#xD;
    usage, the passing of large binary attachments may be a significant factor.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Attachments or Links&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In an Internet architecture, there is an approach to the transfer of large amounts of information, the passing of a URL&#xD;
    that allows the recipient to download the content via a more appropriate protocol such as FTP. This is also very useful&#xD;
    if the data does not change often because it can be placed in a common location for all clients to retrieve; it is also&#xD;
    an efficient mechanism if the message recipient may chose not to download the additional content. This has the&#xD;
    advantage of putting the requirement for attachment download on the client. This may more of a disadvantage and&#xD;
    additional work for the client.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another possible approach for attachments is the &lt;i>well known location&lt;/i>. For example, a part of the documentation&#xD;
    of the service denotes a base URL for attachments and some element of the message denotes an identifier or file name&#xD;
    that can be appended to the URL to get the actual resource to download.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Attachment Encoding&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The message attachment stereotype also has a property that denotes the encoding form of the attachment. Although the&#xD;
    name is the same as the property on a Message, it is recommended that the values used to denote the encoding for&#xD;
    attachments be MIME types. These types are already used by certain Internet infrastructure such as the HTTP protocol in&#xD;
    transferring binary data such as images for Web pages.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For more information on MIME Types see the IETF RFC 2046 - &lt;i>&lt;a href=&quot;http://ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt&quot;>Multipurpose&#xD;
    Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) Part Two: Media Types&lt;/a>&lt;/i>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Example&quot; name=&quot;Example&quot;>An Example&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Let us consider a service that provides a product catalog. Obviously there are operations to find items, execute&#xD;
    queries, and return complete product information. If we look at a subset of the model of the product data, we can see&#xD;
    that each product entry has an associated image and possibly a zoomed-in image for easier viewing. In the model below,&#xD;
    we can also see that the two images are marked as attachments to the product catalog data structure. What we cannot see&#xD;
    in this diagram is that the value for the encoding property is &quot;image/jpeg&quot; in both cases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;96&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram is described in the textual content.&quot; src=&quot;resources/soa_msg_attachments-02.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;456&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As for the example shown above, it would be possible to send a URL for each image, allowing the client to decide if and&#xD;
    when to download the actual image. The URL of course would denote the protocol and location for the download operation.&#xD;
    The following is a version of the ProductCatalogData structure with the images as links.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;88&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram is described in the textual content.&quot; src=&quot;resources/soa_msg_attachments-03.gif&quot;&#xD;
    width=&quot;142&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; />&#xD;
