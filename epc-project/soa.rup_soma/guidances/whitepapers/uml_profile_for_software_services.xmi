    Abstract
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    This paper describes the Unified Modeling Language (UML) Profile for Software Services, a profile for UML 2.0 which
    allows for the modeling of services, SOA, and service-oriented solutions. The aim of the profile is to provide a common
    language for describing services that covers a number of activities through the development lifecycle and also provides
    views to different stakeholders. So, for example, the profile provides capabilities for the architect to map out
    services early in the lifecycle using logical partitions to describe the entire enterprise-wide service portfolio. This
    view is further detailed by designers who develop the structural and behavioral service specifications that act as the
    contracts between the service clients and implementers. The message view provides the ability for designers to reuse
    information models for common service-data definitions.
