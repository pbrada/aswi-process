&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin by examining the Test Evaluation Summaries that the test team has prepared. Compare the evaluation information to&#xD;
    the Test Plan for the iteration to understand the summary in the context of the planned work. Raise any ambiguities and&#xD;
    concerns with the test team members who prepared the summary and resolve them.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For this step and subsequent steps that deal with gathering information and assessing the software quality, try to&#xD;
    obtain a balanced view incorporating both objective and subjective measures. Remember that objective numbers only give&#xD;
    part of the picture and need to be supported and explained by the current project &quot;climate&quot;. Conversely, don't rely&#xD;
    purely on hearsay and subjective speculation about the software quality: look for supporting objective evidence. We&#xD;
    recommend you supplement your objective data by discussion with either team leads or where possible individual team&#xD;
    members to gather subjective assessments and gauge how much confidence you can place in the objective data.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Also review the data yourself and look for important trends evident in the Test Results data that may have been missed.&#xD;
    In general it's more important to identify what the relative trends in the data are indicating rather than looking at&#xD;
    absolute numbers. Be on the lookout for indications such as failures in one areas that relate to failures in others.&#xD;

        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    We recommend you limit this exercise to the most pressing Issues and associated Change Requests. You'll be able to&#xD;
    devote more energy to a smaller number of issues, and they are often more likely to have the most impact on product&#xD;
    quality. If you have a longer list of key issues, we recommend you devote appropriate effort to them based on their&#xD;
    relative priority: don't waste your resources by championing the least significant issue. However, note that a&#xD;
    significant number of outstanding lower-priority Change Requests can make as significant a statement about the products&#xD;
    quality as a handful of high-priority changes. Try to group lower-priority Change Requests into logical aspects of&#xD;
    quality based on the quality risk the represent. This will help you articulate and advocate their combined effect on&#xD;
    quality more clearly.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Identify important trends evident in the general Change Request data. In general it's more important to identify what&#xD;
    the relative trends in the data are indicating rather than looking at absolute numbers. Look for positive signs such as&#xD;
    a steady, continuous rate of defect resolution, or a gradual ongoing increase and subsequent decrease in resolution&#xD;
    rate over time. Be on the lookout for sharp peaks and troughs in resolution rate that indicate the development team may&#xD;
    be encountering process, environmental, political or other problems that are reducing their productivity.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note: you may also want to take the opportunity improve the clarity of the associated Change Requests, eliminating&#xD;
    ambiguity and emotive language and reasoning. If you make these changes yourself, discuss your improvements with the&#xD;
    individuals who originally created these work products so that they can understand why the improvements are important.&#xD;

&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For each key gap in quality, consider potential mitigation and contingency strategies. Formulate your initial ideas for&#xD;
    these and discuss them informally with other team members to gain greater insight and validate your thoughts. In the&#xD;
    case of solutions, it's good to have options: they help you weigh up the tradeoffs and take the best solution for the&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work toward a set of useful candidate solutions and suggestions that will aid the project team in suitably addressing&#xD;
    each quality gap. It's important for you to do this so that the test effort is recognized as contributing helpfully to&#xD;
    problem resolution: not simply reporting problems. This is an important aspect of advocating the value of the test team&#xD;
    and gaining respect and cooperation from other team members.&#xD;

    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's no fun to back a lost cause. It's usually a more effective approach to identify solutions to problems that the&#xD;
    project team are more likely to get behind, accept and commit to achieving. Keep a close relationship with key decision&#xD;
    makers, and consider starting by making these key issues visibly informally through one-on-one discussion. Often that's&#xD;
    a great way to win support, and find achievable solutions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes you don't have any choice but to back a solution that is unpopular with the development team. Where this&#xD;
    looks likely, it's even more important to know who you can expect support form and find ways to sell the solution that&#xD;
    present it's value as clearly as possible or explain clearly the worse situation that will arise by not resolving the&#xD;
    problem.&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is the crux of quality advocacy: being able to negotiate a suitable solution that both appeases the development&#xD;
    team and does not significantly reduce the quality of the product. Remember that in most cases the test team primarily&#xD;
    an advisor about quality, so you must be careful not to demand a given resolution being taken.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, it's important that the test team does a good job as an advocate for quality and that includes sometimes being&#xD;
    the bearer of news the project team would really not like to hear. This is where good test teams provide the&#xD;
    development effort with as much insight into the problem, its potential solutions and as understanding as the&#xD;
    tradeoff's for each choice as possible. You should act to some extent as an agent for the eventual customers of the&#xD;
    product and help negotiate solutions that will be in their best interest.&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Sometimes Defects and other Change Requests get lost in a sea of ongoing basic product development and feature&#xD;
    expansion. This is partly because it's more attractive for developers to work on &quot;new stuff&quot; than it is to fix old and&#xD;
    buggy code, and partly because business-value can be more obviously placed on adding something new than fixing&#xD;
    something broken. As quality advocates, the test team needs to help the project see important defect fixes through to&#xD;
    completion.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Successful software teams find a good balance between incremental quality improvement through defect resolution and&#xD;
    incremental feature expansion. The test team can assist the project team by finding ways to encourage and support&#xD;
    incremental quality improvement rather than taking less helpful and more adversarial &quot;quality police&quot; role.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Whatever solution the development team decide on to resolve a quality issue, the resolution should ultimately improve&#xD;
    quality. Be sure that you take time to assess the improvement in quality brought by a given resolution and that it both&#xD;
    addresses the original issue and does not adversely impact quality in other ways.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    For solutions that carry some level of risk themselves, it may be useful to conduct some testing of an early release&#xD;

    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work was of sufficient value, and that you&#xD;
    did not simply consume vast quantities of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and&#xD;
    that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their&#xD;
    work. Where possible, use the checklists provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people performing the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input take part in reviewing your interim&#xD;
    work. Do this while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate&#xD;
    your work against the key input work products to make sure you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It&#xD;
    may be useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative delivery process and that in many cases work products evolve over time.&#xD;
    As such, it is not usually necessary-and is often counterproductive-to fully-form a work product that will only be&#xD;
    partially used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because there is a high probability&#xD;
    that the situation surrounding the work product will change-and the assumptions made when the work product was created&#xD;
    proven incorrect-before the work product is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid the trap of&#xD;
    spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content value. In project environments where presentation&#xD;
    has importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative resource&#xD;
    to perform presentation tasks.&#xD;
