&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examine the iteration plan, and identify the scope and objectives of the plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's useful to supplement this examination with informal discussions with key project staff such as the project&#xD;
    manager, software architect and customer sponsor; these meetings will often highlight concerns more explicitly than&#xD;
    documented in the plan. Attending iteration kickoff meetings also provides useful information.&#xD;

&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The mission is the governing principal that guides the test effort during a given time period. Testing resources are&#xD;
    typically limited, so the challenge is to balance given testing resource constraints with the quality validation needs&#xD;
    of the software development effort.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Gain an initial understanding at a strategic level of the expectations of the software development team. You should&#xD;
    mainly be concerned with the expectations of the project manager, software architect and lead system analysts.&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It's not a terribly useful practice to consider objectives and scope in isolation from the rest of the project team.&#xD;
    RUP advocates team ownership of product quality, and as such you should include relevant stakeholders from the rest of&#xD;
    the project team when deciding what testing is important. You should consider team members that fill the following&#xD;
    roles as important stakeholders: Project Manager, Architect, System Analyst, Integrator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases, the presentation format will suit being formal, with the stakeholders convening as a review board and&#xD;
    requiring significant preparation in advance. In other cases, &quot;brown-bag&quot; lunches may be appropriate, or individual&#xD;
    interview with each stakeholder. There are good and bad points for each approach: choose the format that best suits you&#xD;
    needs in the context of the current project environment.&#xD;

&lt;div align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid rgb(128,128,128)&quot;&#xD;

                &lt;b>Purpose:&lt;/b>&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
            &lt;td width=&quot;95%&quot;>&#xD;
                To clearly identify the essence of the testing focus for the current Iteration.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Mission statements are helpful in providing focus to a team, especially in situations where the team is faced with many&#xD;
    possible choices. Test teams without an Evaluation Mission often consider that they simply &quot;do testing&quot;: this provides&#xD;
    little guidance when difficult choices must be made regarding the best focus for testing within time or resource&#xD;
    constraints. A mission statement distills the essence of the current work objective and provides a &quot;mantra&quot; to keep the&#xD;
    team focused on the right things.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Formulate a mission statement that can be used by the test team. Don't make it too complex or incorporate too many&#xD;
    conflicting ideas: The best mission statements are simple, short and sweet and in most situations where a decision&#xD;
    needs to be made between possible options, the mission will make it obvious what choice the team should make.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Here some ideas for mission statements you might adopt for a given iteration:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        find as many bugs as possible&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        find important problems fast&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        assess perceived quality risks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        advise about perceived project risks&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        advise about perceived quality&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        certify a standard&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        verify a specification (requirements, design or product claims)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        satisfy stakeholders&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        fulfill process mandates&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Looking through this list, it should occur to you that many missions are mutually exclusive. For example, if my mission&#xD;
    is to &quot;find important problems fast&quot;, I likely won't be able to &quot;verify a specification&quot;: To successfully achieve one&#xD;
    mission often negates other possible missions, and requires a different supporting test approach.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test teams that try to satisfy too many Evaluation Missions often get into trouble, encountering ongoing conflict in&#xD;
    their work. Note also that we recommend choosing or reconsidering your Evaluation Mission in each iteration: it's&#xD;
    natural for the mission to alter over time based on the context of the current work effort.&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Certain work products are deliverables important to one or more stakeholders: other work products are necessary parts&#xD;
    of the test effort and while important to the test team, they are of little interest to those same stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Give some thought to the minimal set of useful deliverables for the test effort. Don't list all work products; only&#xD;
    list those that give direct, tangible benefit to a stakeholder and those by which you want the success of the test&#xD;
    effort to be measured. You might need to adjust your initial list to accommodate the needs of the stakeholders, but you&#xD;
    will need to take an proactive role in encouraging the deliverables to be kept useful and manageable.&#xD;

            &lt;/td>&#xD;
        &lt;/tr>&#xD;
    &lt;/table>&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Now that you have completed the work, it is beneficial to verify that the work was of sufficient value, and that you&#xD;
    did not simply consume vast quantities of paper. You should evaluate whether your work is of appropriate quality, and&#xD;
    that it is complete enough to be useful to those team members who will make subsequent use of it as input to their&#xD;
    work. Where possible, use the checklists provided in RUP to verify that quality and completeness are &quot;good enough&quot;.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Have the people performing the downstream tasks that rely on your work as input take part in reviewing your interim&#xD;
    work. Do this while you still have time available to take action to address their concerns. You should also evaluate&#xD;
    your work against the key input work products to make sure you have represented them accurately and sufficiently. It&#xD;
    may be useful to have the author of the input work product review your work on this basis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Try to remember that that RUP is an iterative delivery process and that in many cases work products evolve over time.&#xD;
    As such, it is not usually necessary-and is often counterproductive-to fully-form a work product that will only be&#xD;
    partially used or will not be used at all in immediately subsequent work. This is because there is a high probability&#xD;
    that the situation surrounding the work product will change-and the assumptions made when the work product was created&#xD;
    proven incorrect-before the work product is used, resulting in wasted effort and costly rework. Also avoid the trap of&#xD;
    spending too many cycles on presentation to the detriment of content value. In project environments where presentation&#xD;
    has importance and economic value as a project deliverable, you might want to consider using an administrative resource&#xD;
    to perform presentation tasks.&#xD;
