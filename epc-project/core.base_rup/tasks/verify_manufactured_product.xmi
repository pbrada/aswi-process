    This task is sometimes referred to as the 'first article inspection'. It serves as a quality control task to ensure&#xD;
    that the retailed product has all the required attributes and work products.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br />&#xD;

    The Deployment Manager needs to be satisfied that the manufactured product is complete. Completion in this instance&#xD;
    means that the product has all the constituent parts listed in the Bill of Materials. The Deployment Manager needs to&#xD;
    go through the checklist and identify the product components.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having made sure that the manufactured product has all the required elements, the Deployment Manager has to ensure that&#xD;
    the customer can load and run the software. This step is really a check to verify the clarity of installation&#xD;
    instructions, as well as how well the installation work products work in the final product.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Having installed the software, the Deployment Manager should go through the various tutorials and try out the product.&#xD;
    The Deployment Manager should look at the product help features and documentation to ensure that all is in order.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As an added precaution, the Deployment Manager should go through the exercise of reporting bugs or calling the Help&#xD;
    Line to check for responsiveness.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assuming that the product passes the visual and usability tests, the Deployment Manager can sign-off the product&#xD;
    release and make it available for shipment to customers. Product shipping is beyond the scope of a software delivery&#xD;
    process, however, it is assumed that a software product development organization has established the right marketing&#xD;
    channels and infrastructure for product distribution.&#xD;
