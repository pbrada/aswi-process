    In developing installation work products the Implementer has to consider how the product is to be packaged, customized&#xD;
    and installed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A typical set of installation work products includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Installation scripts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Setup files&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Installation instructions&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Installation work products should be developed with the same rigor and process followed to develop any other work&#xD;
    product. Typically there is a requirement for a separate set of installation work products for each platform onto which&#xD;
    the product is to be installed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The simplest installation scenario is where the individual user installs the software on a single personal computer&#xD;
    (node). However, in larger development shops it is typically the responsibility of a single role (network&#xD;
    administrator) for overall enterprise-level software management tasks. In this case, there is great benefit from being&#xD;
    able to install and update software on all the workstations quickly and easily from one location. The price for this&#xD;
    convenience is paid in the complexity of installation software required to distribute software and customize&#xD;
    workstations from a single server or across the enterprise.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The developer may want to use some commercially available packages that provide templates and pre-built interface&#xD;
    objects to make it easy to package the software for installation. These packages can be tailored to display product&#xD;
    images and corporate logos.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
