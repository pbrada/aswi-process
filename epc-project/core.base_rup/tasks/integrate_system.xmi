&lt;p>&#xD;
    When this task begins, implementation subsystems have been delivered to satisfy the requirements of the next (the&#xD;
    'target') build described in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_integration_build_plan_31CE4B79.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{FA56B557-857D-4122-8E60-7A4A84418EB1}&quot;>Artifact: Integration Build Plan&lt;/a>, recalling that the Integration&#xD;
    Build Plan may define the need for several builds in an iteration. Depending on the complexity and number of subsystems&#xD;
    to be integrated, it is often more efficient to produce the target build in a number of steps, adding more subsystems&#xD;
    with each step, and producing a series of intermediate 'mini' builds - thus, each build planned for an iteration may,&#xD;
    in turn, have its own sequence of transient intermediate builds. These are subjected to a minimal integration test&#xD;
    (usually a subset of the tests described in the Integration Build Plan for this target build) to ensure that what is&#xD;
    added is compatible with what already exists in the system integration workspace. It should be easier to isolate and&#xD;
    diagnose problems using this approach.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The integrator accepts delivered subsystems incrementally into the system integration workspace, in the process&#xD;
    resolving any merge conflicts.&amp;nbsp;It is recommended that this be done bottom-up with respect to the layered&#xD;
    structure, making sure that the versions of the subsystems are consistent, taking imports into consideration. The&#xD;
    increment of subsystems is compiled and linked into an intermediate build, which is then provided to the tester to&#xD;
    execute a minimal system integration test.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    &lt;img height=&quot;172&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram described in accompanying text.&quot; src=&quot;resources/ac_intsy.gif&quot; width=&quot;501&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    This diagram shows a build produced in three increments. Some subsystems are only needed as stubs, to make it possible&#xD;
    to compile and link the other subsystems, and provide the essential minimal run-time behavior.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;>&#xD;
    The final increment of a sequence produces the target build, as planned in the Integration Build Plan. When this has&#xD;
    been minimally tested, an initial or provisional baseline is created for this build - invoking the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/tasks/create_baseline_30FA138.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{F8256B31-5CE3-49C0-9DC2-ECB57DD48867}&quot;>Task: Create Baselines&lt;/a> in the Configuration Management discipline.&#xD;
    The build is now made available to the tester for complete system testing. The nature and depth of this testing will be&#xD;
    as planned in the Integration Build Plan, with the final build of an iteration being subjected to all the tests defined&#xD;
    in the Iteration Test Plan.&lt;br />&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>As a build passes various levels of test, the associated baselines are promoted accordingly. This is done by invoking the&#xD;
&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/tasks/promote_baseline_623F1B0E.html&quot;&#xD;
guid=&quot;{9139A97B-D458-490D-A9D5-CDBB86968475}&quot;>Task: Promote Baselines&lt;/a> in the Configuration Management discipline.&#xD;
Promotion is a means of marking baselines as having passed or failed a certain level of testing. The names of the promotion&#xD;
levels are defined by the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/roles/rup_configuration_manager_9B799A15.html&quot;&#xD;
guid=&quot;{8939FDEF-EC44-4009-9F16-FAD4CFAA0B2D}&quot;>Role: Configuration Manager&lt;/a> as part of defining project configuration&#xD;
policies. The promotion levels are important to consumers of the baseline: for example, an implementer will want to know&#xD;
that a baseline is stable and tested before updating (or 'rebaselining') a private development workspace to be consistent&#xD;
with a baseline in the system integration workspace.</sectionDescription>
