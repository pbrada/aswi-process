  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_iteration_plan_623AFF7F.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{97269E0F-CDF3-448D-A732-DF39D099BDDD}&quot;>Iteration Plan&lt;/a> prepared at the start of the iteration can select only&#xD;
    from what is known at the time. This will be an increment of the total capability required (functional and&#xD;
    non-functional requirements), and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_change_request_F2E6419.html&quot; guid=&quot;{694A7BC8-3D20-4172-BC56-6C7BD4590BA5}&quot;>Change&#xD;
    Requests&lt;/a> left over from previous iterations. The Project Manager can then determine the resources and schedule for&#xD;
    the iteration. Allowance for defects should be built into the plan for the iteration, either implicitly, in the effort&#xD;
    allocated to the production of a work product, or explicitly, in particular activities. It is recommended that the&#xD;
    latter method be adopted and the Rational Unified Process contains tasks to make this possible.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Although the priority for fixes is assigned by the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/roles/rup_change_manager_51E43456.html&quot; guid=&quot;{C1D3C2C0-15A0-49AD-9788-8C163E53CB96}&quot;>Change Control&#xD;
    Manager&lt;/a>, Project Manager may still exercise some planning discretion in deciding when fixes should be made - but in&#xD;
    general, an attempt should be made to correct defects in the iteration in which they are discovered, and it should be&#xD;
    possible to do this with the resources planned at the start of the iteration. There will inevitably be some&#xD;
    (discovered) defects left unfixed at the end of an iteration (because an iteration should be timeboxed), but for the&#xD;
    iteration to be deemed a success, it is not likely that many of these would be severe or rated high priority for other&#xD;
    reasons.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Little allowance can be made, however, for other than trivial enhancement requests, that arise unexpectedly. If such a&#xD;
    Change Request for a substantial enhancement is sanctioned for the current iteration, the Project Manager will almost&#xD;
    certainly have to re-plan, either by pushing off some planned capability to the next iteration, or by finding extra&#xD;
    resources to make the change. Usually, such requests for enhancements will be held over for the next iteration, or even&#xD;
    later ones, and then be made part of the regular iteration planning cycle.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;Allocate Change Request to an Iteration&quot; name=&quot;Allocate Change Request to an Iteration&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Change Request is examined and the Project Manager decides, based on its type, priority and severity, in which&#xD;
    iteration it should be fixed. If the Change Request is to be held until a later iteration, the Project Manager simply&#xD;
    re-plans the future iterations (in the Software Development Plan), so that the impact of the Change Request is&#xD;
    understood now, and resource acquisition tasks can be initiated as early as possible, to avoid unpleasant surprises&#xD;
    later.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Change Request should already contain a description in outline of the required change (because the Change Request&#xD;
    has already been analyzed and approved). This step refines that description into an unambiguous statement of what is to&#xD;
    be done and produced.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Manager, in consultation with those responsible for the Change Request, refines the effort and other&#xD;
    resource estimates in the Change Request into firm planning estimates, to which the responsible staff are expected to&#xD;
    commit.&#xD;

    If the Change Request is to be implemented in the current iteration, the Project Manager, in consultation with those&#xD;
    assigned responsibility, will set a start date and expected duration for the work.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    If necessary, the current Iteration Plan is revised, and any impact on future iterations should be reflected in the&#xD;
    Software Development Plan. As a result of the re-planning, the Project Manager may have to invoke the &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/tasks/handle_exceptions_and_problems_C64D3CB1.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{E497E75A-2E69-474E-A814-42BBD8081D1F}&quot;>Task: Handle Exceptions and Problems&lt;/a>, to bring the project state into&#xD;

    planned capability to later iterations.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Work Order(s) defining the work to be done, schedule, responsibility, and so on, are issued by the Project Manager.&#xD;
    The&amp;nbsp;activity (in the work breakdown structure) against which the effort is budgeted, is identified in the Work&#xD;
