    Beta testing serves two purposes: firstly it gives the product a controlled &quot;real-world&quot; test, and secondly it provides&#xD;
    a preview of the next release.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Beta testing is &quot;pre-release&quot; testing in which a sampling of the intended audience tries out the product. It is a good&#xD;
    idea for a company to keep a database of potential beta reviewers and an archive of their feedback. The Deployment&#xD;
    Manager can decide on reviewer profile characteristics, and select beta-reviewers from the reviewers database, staff&#xD;
    nominations and others who may have expressed an interest to sign-up for a beta program.&#xD;
&lt;/p></sectionDescription>

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Manager needs to make the deployment unit (consisting of a build, user support material, release notes,&#xD;
    and installation work products) available to the reviewers. The deployment unit can be shipped, or made available on a&#xD;
    product page of an internal web site. Participants in the beta program will need to be provided passwords to download&#xD;
    the product, as well as limited licenses.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Manager also needs to make sure that any participating beta site has signed and accepted the terms of&#xD;
    the beta program such that there is a legally binding beta agreement. The beta agreement should cover the termination&#xD;
    clause, review duration, confidentiality and non modification or transfer of the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Manager should provide a feedback e-mail alias on where to mail the questionnaires in the Release Notes&#xD;
    and User Material that accompanies the beta product. Another method to gather feedback is to have the beta reviewer&#xD;
    respond to on-line queries.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Manager gathers and reviews the feedback and raises Change Requests based on reviewer feedback. The&#xD;
    Change Requests are submitted as part of the Change Control mechanism for review by the Change Control Board. The&#xD;
    Change Control Board determines the relative importance of each request, and whether it warrants further action. The&#xD;
    Deployment Manager should prepare an Results Evaluation Summary and brief the project on the specifics of the beta&#xD;
    feedback.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Some companies maintain a Beta News Letter that is distributed to reviewers informing them of upcoming product reviews&#xD;
    and general trends. In any case, the Deployment Manager should make the effort to acknowledge the valued beta reviews.&#xD;
    In some cases a personal response on the follow up on a particular issue is a good idea.&#xD;
