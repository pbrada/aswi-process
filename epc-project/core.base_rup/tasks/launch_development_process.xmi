    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Unless the change is trivial, you need to educate the project members about the new &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_development_process_A6449790.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{345D1811-317B-47EC-AC9D-10E1072A7D68}&quot;>Development Process&lt;/a>, including&amp;nbsp; any guidelines, templates and/or&#xD;
    tools.&amp;nbsp; This can vary from an informal 2 hour presentation to more formal training, depending on the size of the&#xD;
    project and the project members' familiarity with similar development processes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following are commonly used ways to educate the project members:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Seminar.&lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;
         If the change is small or easy to understand it can be acceptable if the process engineer presents the new on a&#xD;
        seminar. This type of seminar typically takes 1-3 hours.&amp;nbsp;This is often the preferred choice when re-launching&#xD;
        the process for an iteration, and the changes from the last launch are minor.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>&quot;Kick-start&quot; workshop.&lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;
         Arrange a one-day workshop for all project members, where they follow the new development process and use the&#xD;
        tools. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/development_process_workshop_22AE9273.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;2.52896613453697E-306&quot;>Guideline: Development Process Workshop&lt;/a>, for details on how to arrange such a&#xD;
        workshop. Notice that a &quot;kick-start&quot; workshop assumes that the participants have taken the relevant standard&#xD;
        training courses.&amp;nbsp;Always consider the cost of the workshops against the expected value to the project.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Customized training courses.&lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;
         If the project member have not attended the standard training courses in process and tools, an alternative is to&#xD;
        customize the standard training courses, to cover the project's development process, including guidelines,&#xD;
        templates and tools. However, it can be expensive to customize training courses. Generic process training, like an&#xD;
        introductory course to the Rational Unified Process&amp;trade;, should be conducted prior to project startup, or in the early&#xD;
        days of the project. More specialized training in techniques, methods or technologies, is often conducted&#xD;
        &quot;just-in-time&quot;. This means that the training is given shortly before the method or technique is to be applied in&#xD;
        the project, to ensure that new knowledge is fresh in mind.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>&quot;Boot-camps&quot;.&lt;/b>&lt;br />&#xD;
         1-5 weeks of concentrated hands-on training. Not many organizations can afford to arrange these kinds of&#xD;
        boot-camps, but they have proven to be efficient if there are many new factors for the people in the&#xD;
        project.&amp;nbsp;A boot-camp is typically a mixture of seminars, training courses and hands-on work with the process&#xD;
        and tools.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

  <sections xmi:id="_B2mBUEDJEdqshZoCz1jKqQ" name="Collect Feedback" guid="_B2mBUEDJEdqshZoCz1jKqQ">
    <sectionDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    While presenting the new material and educating project members, you are likely to receive feedback and discover&#xD;
    defects in the development process and/or tools. Generate &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_change_request_F2E6419.html&quot; guid=&quot;{694A7BC8-3D20-4172-BC56-6C7BD4590BA5}&quot;>Change&#xD;
    Request&lt;/a>, where appropriate. Some changes may be need to be addressed outside the scope of the project, for example&#xD;
    by the process group responsible for the organization wide development process. Other issues may be raised against the&#xD;
    way the project has chosen to tailor the process and a resolution to the problem should be considered for the next&#xD;
    internal release of the process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is often worth while to follow up a process launch to ensure that the project members &quot;got the message&quot;. It is&#xD;
    perceived as difficult by many individuals to ask for clarifications during a presentation, especially when a lot of&#xD;
    people, internal and external, are present. In many projects, the responsibilities of a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/roles/rup_process_engineer_5954DBA2.html&quot; guid=&quot;{ADDC62A7-8E36-4DCE-9E5C-211B0950EBB5}&quot;>Process&#xD;
    Engineer&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;also includes performing process mentoring to help the project members applying the techniques&#xD;
    described by the process. This work will often result in feedback you don't usually capture during a launch.&amp;nbsp; For&#xD;
    more information, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/mentoring_8E4A53E6.html&quot;&#xD;

  <keyConsiderations>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Process Engineer needs to work with the Project Manager to make the project-specific &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    project members.&#xD;

  <purpose>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of this task is to:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Ensure that the project members are properly introduced to the process.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Harvest any feedback on the process and refine the process, as necessary.&#xD;
