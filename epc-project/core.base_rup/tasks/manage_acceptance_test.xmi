&lt;p>&#xD;
    Acceptance testing is formal testing conducted to determine whether or not a system satisfies its acceptance criteria,&#xD;
    and to enable the customer, user or authorized entity to determine whether or not to accept the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Acceptance testing is often conducted at the development site, and then at the customer site using the target&#xD;
    environment.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    How the customer evaluates the deliverables to determine whether they meet predefined set of acceptance criteria is&#xD;
    described in the Product Acceptance Plan. The Product Acceptance Plan describes the roles, responsibilities, required&#xD;
    resources, tasks, test cases and acceptance criteria required to determine the acceptability of the product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another useful input to determining the project's readiness for formal test are the Configuration Audit Findings that&#xD;
    report on whether the developed software conforms to its requirements and whether the required work products are&#xD;
    physically present.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deficiencies in the Configuration Audit Findings could result in the Acceptance Test being postponed. The Deployment&#xD;
    Manager should review minor deficiencies with the customer, for whose benefit the formal tests are conducted, to&#xD;
    determine whether testing should proceed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The System Administrator needs to ensure that the infrastructure (hardware and software resources), and support&#xD;
    software is ready for the upcoming test tasks.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the Deployment Manager is satisfied with respect to readiness of all items that need to be tested, he follows the&#xD;
    agreed upon test schedule outlined in the Product Acceptance Plan. Testing begins when all participants required for&#xD;
    witnessing and running the test are present.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Tester loads all the software and test data files, and proceeds with the testing using the collection of&amp;nbsp; test&#xD;
    cases, test procedures, test scripts, and expected test results in the test model. Test results are recorded together&#xD;
    with any discrepancies between the expected and actual results.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Test results should be reviewed at the end of each day at a Test Results Review Meeting. At this meeting, results for&#xD;
    each test case need to be reviewed and noted as being &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;not acceptable&quot;. The minutes of the meeting need&#xD;
    to record any significant discussions and decisions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In case of the test results that are considered to be &quot;unacceptable&quot;, the Deployment Manager can raise Change Requests&#xD;
    for the anomalies and submit them as part of Change Control mechanism for review by the Change Control Board.&#xD;
