&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Bill of Materials uniquely identifies all constituent parts of a product or deployment unit. The Deployment Manager&#xD;
    needs to make sure that the tested and approved version of the software and all product enclosures are ready for&#xD;
    delivery and mass-production.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The shrink-wrapped product will consist of the software on some form of storage media, user documents or manuals,&#xD;
    licensing agreement forms, and the packaging itself.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Manager needs to ensure that all of the items for manufacture are in their final, approved state at the&#xD;
    time of delivery to the manufacturer. The approved application and installation software needs to be checked for any&#xD;
    viruses and saved on a storage medium that can be mass-produced; for example, CDs. The user documents or manuals need&#xD;
    to be in their print-ready format. All details relating to the time it takes to prepare all of the items for delivery&#xD;
    are captured in the Deployment Plan.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    After all component parts are in place and you have verified they are complete, they can be handed over to the&#xD;
    manufacturing organization for mass-production.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Interestingly, the manufacturing process influences what will be included on the Bill of Materials. For example, if&#xD;
    your product will be shipped in boxes, then a distinguishing feature for a particular product could be the labels that&#xD;
    are attached to the boxes. In such a case, the item that appears on the Bill of Materials is labels, rather than boxes.&#xD;
