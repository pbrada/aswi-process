&lt;p>&#xD;
    Project &quot;indicators&quot; are pieces of project information that give a picture of the health of the project's progress&#xD;
    against the software development plan. Typically a project manager will be concerned with indicators that apply to the&#xD;
    project's scope of work, budget, quality, and risks. As a project progresses, the project manager will monitor these&#xD;
    indicators and instigate corrective actions when they exceed pre-defined trigger conditions (see &lt;a&#xD;
    href=&quot;#Define%20procedure%20&amp;amp;%20thresholds%20for%20corrective%20action&quot;>Define procedure &amp;amp; thresholds for&#xD;
    corrective action&lt;/a>). These project indicators may include the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Total spending vs. budget&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Revised scope (work done + estimates to complete) vs. planned scope&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Defect density vs. quality objectives&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Risk indicators (situations that tell you a risk is being realized)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The definition of these indicators is driven by the project's budget, quality objectives and schedule (detailed in the&#xD;
    Software Development Plan) and is captured in the project's Measurement Plan and Risk Management Plan.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The projector indicators, in most cases, will be consolidated project measures calculated from more granular primitive&#xD;
    metrics. that are reported by the project team on a regular basis. How these primitive metrics are to be captured, and&#xD;
    the process for using them to calculate the project indicators is defined in the project's Measurement Plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Other indicators (especially risk indicators) may be simply the status of whether a particular situation has occurred&#xD;
    or not. For these cases, the source of the information on the indicator status is all that needs to be identified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;i>Section 4.4 Project Monitoring and Control&lt;/i> of the Software Development Plan should include a brief description&#xD;
    of the project indicators that will be used on your project. Note that there are separate sub-sections in this section&#xD;
    of the SDP covering control of the project's schedule, budget, and quality. Control of project requirements is dealt&#xD;
    with separately in the Requirements Management Plan.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the primitive metrics and project indicators have been defined, you should define the procedure and reporting&#xD;
    frequency for project team members to report their status. This procedure should describe the process for booking time&#xD;
    against activities, reporting the completion of tasks, achievement of project milestones and reporting of issues. To&#xD;
    ensure a consistent flow if information, it is typical for standard templates to be defined for timesheets and team&#xD;
    member status reports.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This procedure is documented in &lt;i>Section 4.4.5 Reporting Plan&lt;/i> of the Software Development Plan.&#xD;

name=&quot;Define procedure &amp;amp; thresholds for corrective action&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In order to maintain effective control of the project, the project manager defines threshold (or trigger)&#xD;
    values/conditions for each of the defined project indicators. These threshold conditions are recorded in the&#xD;
    appropriate sections of &lt;i>Section 4.4 Project Monitoring and Control&lt;/i> of the Software Development Plan.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When these thresholds are exceeded, the project manager must take corrective action in order to bring the project back&#xD;
    on track. Depending on the severity of the condition, the project manager may be able to resolve the situation within&#xD;
    his authority (by issuing appropriate work orders). If the situation goes beyond the project manager's authority he&#xD;
    will need to issue a Change Request and activate the project's change control process.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;i>Section 4.4.5 Reporting Plan&lt;/i> of the Software Development Plan should also describe the frequency and procedure&#xD;
    for the project manager to report project progress to the Project Review Authority (by issuing a Status Assessment).&#xD;
    This procedure describes when and where scheduled and un-scheduled PRA Reviews will occur, and what information is to&#xD;
    be included in the Status Assessment. The project manager will use the Issues List for continuous recording and&#xD;
    tracking of problems (that are not the subject of some other management control instrument, such as the Change Request&#xD;
    or the Risk List) in the periods between the production of Status Assessments.&#xD;
