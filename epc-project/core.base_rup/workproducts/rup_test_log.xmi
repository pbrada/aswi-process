    &lt;!--StartFragment-->The Test Log provides a detailed, typically time-based record that serves both as verification that&#xD;
    a set of tests were executed, and provides information relating to the success of those tests. The focus is typically&#xD;
    on the provision of an accurate audit trail, enabling post-execution diagnosis of failures to be undertaken. This raw&#xD;
    data will subsequently be analyzed to help determine the results of some aspect of the test effort.&lt;!--EndFragment-->&#xD;

    Each Test Log should be made up of a series of entries that present an audit trail for various aspects of the test&#xD;
    execution including, but not limited to, the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        the date and time stamp of when the event occurred&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        a description (usually brief) of the event logged&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        some indication of the observed status&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        additional contextual information where relevant&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        additional details relating to any anomalous or erroneous condition detected&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Automation tools often provide their own Test Log facilities, which can be extended or supplemented with additional&#xD;
    logging provided both through custom user-routines and the use of additional tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The output may take one single or many different forms. Typically, Test Logs have a tabular or spreadsheet-like&#xD;
    appearance, with each entry comprising some form of date and time stamp, a description of the event logged, some&#xD;
    indication the observed status, and possibly some additional contextual information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    If you are using automated test tools, such as those found in the Rational Suite family of products, much of the above&#xD;
    functionality is provided by default with the tool. These Test Log facilities typically provide the ability for the&#xD;
    capture, filtering and sorting and the analysis of the information contained in the log. This allows the Test Log to be&#xD;
    expanded in detail or collapsed to a summary view as required. The tools also offer the ability to customize and retain&#xD;
    views of the Test Log for reporting purposes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Where the logic that produces an automated Test Log simply appends new information to an existing log file, it will be&#xD;
    necessary to provide sufficient storage to retain the Test Log file. An alternative solution to this approach is to use&#xD;
    a &lt;i>ring buffer&lt;/i>. A good explanation of &lt;a href=&quot;http://visibleworkings.com/trace/Documentation/ring-buffer.pdf&quot;&#xD;
    target=&quot;_blank&quot;>using Ring Buffer Logging to help find Bugs&lt;/a> is presented in a pattern catalog by Brian Marick. (Get&#xD;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/alternate.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>Adobe reader&lt;/a>.) This catalog provides&#xD;
    an overview of other classic problems with using automated Test Logs.&#xD;
