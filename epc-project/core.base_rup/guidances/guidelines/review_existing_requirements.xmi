    You may have requirements specifications from previous or otherwise related systems for reference - these may be&#xD;
    helpful to walk through. Or you may have started using the Rational Unified Process some time after the project&#xD;
    started.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With the group, walk through each requirement to find application behaviors or behavioral attributes. In general,&#xD;
    during the walkthrough, you should ignore explanatory information like introductions and general system descriptions.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keep a list of all issues you identify and make sure someone is tasked to resolve each issue. You may need to make some&#xD;
    assumptions if a requirement is unclear. Keep track of these assumptions so you can verify them with the stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Remember who wrote the requirements. Look for possible &quot;misplaced requirements&quot;, meaning things that are out of scope&#xD;
    for the project. If you don't know whether something is a requirement, ask the stakeholders.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is very effective to perform this type of walkthroughs by using any existing use-case outlines as a framework. Each&#xD;
    requirement needs to relate to at least one use case in your outline. If there is no use case to relate to, it is an&#xD;
    indication that either a use case is missing or that the requirement is misplaced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
