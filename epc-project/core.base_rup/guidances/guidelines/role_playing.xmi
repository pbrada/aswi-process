    Each member of the group is assigned a role that is of interest to the system. Roles are users, the system itself,&#xD;
    other systems, and sometimes entities that are maintained by the system. The group then walks through how the system is&#xD;
    used. Along the way, there will be discussions about who is responsible for what-take notes on the responsibilities of&#xD;
    each role. Having the system analyst play the role of the user or customer helps gain real insights into the problem&#xD;
    domain.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a frame work for the role play, you may perform scripted walkthroughs of how the system is used. If you have some&#xD;
    use cases outlined, you can use them as a basis for the script. The walkthrough can also be performed at a business&#xD;
    level, using the business use cases as a basis for the script.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another technique often combined with role playing is Class Responsibility Collaboration (CRC) cards.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;br />&#xD;
