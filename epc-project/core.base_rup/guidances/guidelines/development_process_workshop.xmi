&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the process and tools have been tailored, you need to train the members of the project on what the resulting&#xD;
    process is, what can be found in the guidelines, the templates, and how to use the new tools.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The purpose of a &quot;kick-start&quot; workshop of this kind is to get people in the project up-to-speed using the new process&#xD;
    and new tools as quickly as possible. The workshop does not replace standard training courses.&amp;#160;It should be an&#xD;
    efficient way to get the members of the project up-to-speed on any new part of their development environment. You&#xD;
    should work on material that can be perceived as &quot;real&quot; project material, and follow the new parts of the development&#xD;
    process, together with the new templates, guidelines and tools. The main purpose is to get hands-on experience of using&#xD;
    the new sections of the development process together with templates, guidelines and tools. The workshop is also a way&#xD;
    to verify the development process, templates, guidelines and tools.&amp;#160;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Specialist&lt;/a> should prepare and facilitate the workshop. It is essential that they are people with in-depth knowledge&#xD;
    of the process and the relevant tools.&amp;#160;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All people in the project that are going to work according to the development process and use the tools, should attend.&#xD;
    To be efficient, the workshop should require that the participants have knowledge in process and tools, equivalent to&#xD;
    what is taught in standard training courses.&amp;#160;If the project team is large, divide up in smaller teams of 10-15&#xD;
    people each and conduct the workshop with each team. Otherwise, there is a value in bringing all members of the project&#xD;
    together to walk through the process and the tools in order to make sure you all have a similar understanding and&#xD;
    perception of the development environment.&amp;#160;&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A workshop of this kind does not replace any standard training courses on process and tools, rather, those kind of&#xD;
    courses are a pre-requisite for this workshop. But, one of the first things you should put in place is what your&#xD;
    audience will look like so that you know what basic knowledge you can assume from the participants of the workshop. Try&#xD;
    to understand what level of experience they have, both of the technology to be applied as well as of the problem&#xD;
    domain.&amp;#160;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Establish the objectives of the workshop. Typically, they would be:&amp;#160;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The primary objective of the workshop is to get the participants up-to-speed on the new process and tools.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The secondary objective is to get feedback on the new process and tools. The participants are expected to provide&#xD;
        feedback for improvements.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In addition, you may have objective such as letting the members of you team meet for the first time and establish how&#xD;
    they will work together.&amp;#160;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Determine the duration of the workshop. Unless there are very specific needs, you should try to limit the duration to&#xD;
    one day. Remember that standard training courses should be a pre-requisite, and the focus is on understanding specifics&#xD;
    of your development environment.&amp;#160;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a facilitator you need to prepare materials for the workshop. As this is an event that may not be conducted more&#xD;
    than a few times, you need to make sure you don't 'over invest' in materials. The materials you use should mainly be&#xD;
    materials or work products that you develop anyway for the project.&amp;#160;The only additional materials would be:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An agenda for the workshop, based on the process you will follow.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        An example to work with during the workshop. This can preferably be an example from your environment, maybe even a&#xD;
        small part of the application that will be a result of the project.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In terms of logistics, you need to make sure the following is available:&amp;#160;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A conference room where you can tape the walls with the results of your work.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Computers, set up so that you can use your development environment.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The tools that will be used by the development team, including the Rational Unified Process (RUP).&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The development process itself, including any organization/project-specific guidelines and templates.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&#xD;
        .&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You also need to set the right expectations on the workshop. The stakeholders of the class - its participants as well&#xD;
    as any of the managers who decide to invest in the workshop - should be aware that:&amp;#160;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The workshop is &lt;b>not&lt;/b> a standard training course. There will not be professional quality training materials,&#xD;
        nor will there be well-prepared teachers.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        There will be some agenda, but it will probably change during the course of the workshop.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The workshop does &lt;b>not&lt;/b> replace standard training courses.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The participants must have good knowledge about the process and tools, equivalent to the relevant standard training&#xD;
        courses.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The students are expected to be pro-active, the workshop facilitators should not have to lead them each and every&#xD;
        step of the way. &amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Conduct the Workshop&quot; name=&quot;Conduct the Workshop&quot;>Conduct the Workshop&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The facilitator conducts the workshop, which includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Giving everyone an opportunity to speak.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Keeping the session on track. There is a great tendency for these kind of workshops to turn into philosophical&#xD;
        elaborations on the general problems of developing software.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Gathering input on the development process presented. Make sure you record any problems discovered, but do not&#xD;
        dwell on them if you don't have the right competencies represented to solve them.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Gather input on the format and delivery of the development process workshop.&amp;#160;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Summarizing the session and working out conclusions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Concluding the Workshop&quot; name=&quot;Concluding the Workshop&quot;>Concluding the Workshop&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After the development process workshop, the facilitator, along with fellow process engineers, needs to spend time to&#xD;
    analyze any inputs participants gave on the development process as well as the workshop format.&#xD;
