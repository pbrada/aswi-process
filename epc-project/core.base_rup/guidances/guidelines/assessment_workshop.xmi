                        &lt;/ul>&#xD;
                    &lt;/td>&#xD;
                &lt;/tr>&#xD;
            &lt;/tbody>&#xD;
        &lt;/table>&#xD;
    &lt;/center>&#xD;
&lt;/div>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Preparation&quot; name=&quot;Preparation&quot;>Prepare&lt;/a> for the Workshop&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conducting an assessment workshop means gathering all stakeholders for an intensive, focused session. Typically, an&#xD;
    assessment workshop takes half a day or a full day to conduct.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The process engineer prepares a presentation of the approach that will be taken to implement a process. Such a&#xD;
    presentation should take 1-3 hours, depending on the audience's background.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Ask a representative of the development organization to prepare a presentation on how the development organization&#xD;
    currently works. The presentation should take no more than an hour and covers areas, such as organizational structure,&#xD;
    number of people, people's competence and experience, business goals and objectives, and brief descriptions of typical&#xD;
    projects. The presentation should also discuss the underlying reasons behind the organization's decision to change&#xD;
    process and tools, such as problems, changing business context, and so on.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note: An assessment workshop is just one of several ways to gather information about an organization. It needs to be&#xD;
    complemented by other methods for collecting information.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Who&quot; name=&quot;Who&quot;>Who&lt;/a> Should Attend&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A process engineer should act as a facilitator. Normally, it's good if the facilitator is not part of the development&#xD;
    organization. It's easier, perhaps even essential, for an external person to give a fresh perspective and to ask the&#xD;
    necessary provocative questions that elicit underlying problems. Because changing the software development process is&#xD;
    often politically charged, it's essential that the facilitator is respected by all parties, and is viewed as fair and&#xD;
    impartial.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The number of participants should be between 3 and 8, including the facilitator. The assessment workshop includes&#xD;
    representatives from several different areas of the organization to give as accurate a picture of the current state as&#xD;
    possible. Invite a good mix of people to cover as many areas as possible, such as:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Project managers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software architects&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Experienced analysts&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Experienced developers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Experienced testers&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Development department manager&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Changes in the software engineering process will affect many people in the software development organization,&#xD;
    therefore, many people will want to be involved. There are some advantages to this because participation often breeds&#xD;
    support. The tendency to include more people in the workshop, however, should be strongly resisted. Increasing the&#xD;
    number of people makes the workshop harder, or impossible, to manage. As an alternative, consider having each team&#xD;
    elect a representative to the workshop or conduct several workshops, one for each team. The purpose of the workshop is&#xD;
    to gather information, not to make decisions. As long as people feel their concerns as adequately represented, they&#xD;
    tend to be supportive of the process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Before&quot; name=&quot;Before&quot;>Before&lt;/a> the Workshop&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The facilitator needs to sell the workshop to those who should attend, thereby establishing the group who will&#xD;
    participate in the workshop. Give the attendees preparatory material to review before they arrive, especially the&#xD;
    process engineer who should be as well prepared as possible. The preparatory material should include an agenda for the&#xD;
    workshop that communicates the workshop's scope and goals which need to be reviewed by each participant. Doing this&#xD;
    will identify any possible issues or hidden agendas before the workshop begins.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The facilitator or process engineer needs access to materials such as descriptions of the development organization and&#xD;
    descriptions of the existing process.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Conduct&quot; name=&quot;Conduct&quot;>Conduct&lt;/a> the Workshop&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The facilitator conducts the workshop, which includes:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Giving everyone an opportunity to speak. This is essential if the workshop is to be perceived as fair and&#xD;
        impartial.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Keeping the session on track. There is a great tendency for these kind of workshops to turn into gripe sessions.&#xD;
        Identify problems, but do not dwell on them. Once a problem has been identified, move on.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Gathering input.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Gathering the findings.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Summarizing the session and working out conclusions.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A typical agenda for an assessment workshop would include:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Give a presentation of the development organization by one of its senior representatives.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Give a presentation of the assessment approach by a process engineer.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify problem areas. Conduct a brainstorming session to identify all problems in the development organization.&#xD;
        See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

        guid=&quot;1.2379282201043798E-305&quot;>Guideline: Brainstorming and Idea Reduction&lt;/a> for how to conduct a brainstorming&#xD;
        session. Make sure that every part of the development organization is covered.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Rank the problem areas. Come up with a ranking order between the problem areas. Consider using &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/pareto_diagrams_8192A4DE.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;3.7162984695584875E-306&quot;>Pareto Diagrams&lt;/a>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify the root causes of the problems. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/fishbone_diagrams_AB0E2DBE.html&quot; guid=&quot;1.0533204494757043E-304&quot;>Fishbone&#xD;
        Diagrams&lt;/a> can be helpful for doing this. Be careful not to spend too much time identifying root causes because&#xD;
        the primary focus of the assessment workshop is to uncover visible problems. Continual information collection and&#xD;
        later analysis by the process engineer will aim at uncovering the root causes.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Summarize the problems. The facilitator summarizes the meeting and its outcome. Give the participants a chance to&#xD;
        express whether they agree, or if they there is anything to add or withdraw.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify two or three projects where the problems can be further studied.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Identify persons to interview for the assessment.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Outline a schedule for the remaining assessment tasks. If possible, set dates for interviews and future workshops.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Facilitating&quot; name=&quot;Facilitating&quot;>Facilitate&lt;/a> Communication&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An assessment workshop is about communication between people. To make it easier to understand each other, you need a&#xD;
    common understanding of the software-development process. If the development organization knows the Rational Unified&#xD;
    Process (RUP), you could use the disciplines as a roadmap to cover all the different areas of the development process.&#xD;
    However, if the organization already uses another process and the participants do not have a good knowledge of the RUP,&#xD;
    we recommend that the process engineer uses the customer's development process as a framework during the assessment&#xD;
    workshop and during interviews. This makes it much easier for the participants to express themselves and you don't want&#xD;
    to spend time during the workshop trying to teach the participants the RUP.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An example of another development process model is the ISO/IEC 12207 standard, which is described as activities and is&#xD;
    organized in the following sections:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Process implementation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System requirements analysis&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System architectural design&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software requirements analysis&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software architectural design&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software detailed design&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software coding and testing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software integration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software qualification testing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System integration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        System qualification testing&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software installation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Software acceptance support&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Consolidate&quot; name=&quot;Consolidate&quot;>Consolidate&lt;/a> Results&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    After the assessment workshop, the facilitator, along with fellow process engineers, needs to spend more time&#xD;
    synthesizing the findings and condensing the information into a presentable format. The conclusions should be the&#xD;
    product of the workshop participants, rather than those of the facilitator.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The organization itself must express ownership of the conclusions if any progress is to be made. Collectively, they&#xD;
    need to agree on the problems that need to be solved, and express them in a non-judgmental way. The purpose of the&#xD;
    assessment is to identify areas that require improvement, not to criticize or accuse individuals.&#xD;
