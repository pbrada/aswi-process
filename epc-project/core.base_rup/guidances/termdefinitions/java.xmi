  <mainDescription>Java is a programming language invented by Sun Microsystems that is specifically designed for writing programs that can be&#xD;
safely downloaded to your computer through the Internet and immediately run without fear of viruses or other harm to your&#xD;
computer or files. Using small Java programs called applets, Web pages can include functions such as animations,&#xD;
calculators, and other fancy tricks. We can expect to see a huge variety of features added to the Web using Java, since you&#xD;
can write a Java program to do almost anything a regular computer program can do, and then include that Java program in a&#xD;
Web page.</mainDescription>
