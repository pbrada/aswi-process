  <mainDescription>The approach to the management of an iteration's schedule recommended in the RUP: having initially established the scope&#xD;
and schedule for an iteration, the project manager is encouraged to actively manage that scope (and the resources committed&#xD;
to the iteration) so as to meet the planned iteration end date, rather than slipping the end date to accommodate the&#xD;
originally planned scope, if development takes longer than planned. In the RUP, reduction of scope is preferred to addition&#xD;
of resources to manage a slipping schedule. The motivations for this approach are to make the results of an iteration&#xD;
visible to the stakeholders and to assess the iteration, so that the lessons learned may be applied to subsequent&#xD;
iterations.</mainDescription>
