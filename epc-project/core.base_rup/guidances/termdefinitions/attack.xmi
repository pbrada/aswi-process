  <mainDescription>A planned and methodical attempt to break or otherwise circumvent the normal operation of a running computer software&#xD;
program. Often malicious in nature, the concept of attacking computer software originated in the software hacker (A.K.A&#xD;
cracker) community whose members use various techniques to attack software systems, typically to circumvent security&#xD;
software and gain illegal entry to a host system. Examples of recognized attack techniques include buffer overflow, denial&#xD;
of service, resource constraint and Trojan horse. This term has subsequently been adopted by computer software testing&#xD;
professionals in discussing the methods by which they might expose potential bugs in a software system.</mainDescription>
