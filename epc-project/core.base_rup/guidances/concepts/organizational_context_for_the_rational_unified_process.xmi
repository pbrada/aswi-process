&lt;p>&#xD;
    Projects do not run in isolation, they rely on care and feeding from their supporting organizations. The nature of that&#xD;
    support is characterized in the following sections. The Rational Unified Process (RUP) assumes that the kinds of&#xD;
    services described here will be available from outside the project and that in any organization there will exist some&#xD;
    equivalent capability to provide them, but does not prescribe the structure or operation of these entities. The&#xD;
    following descriptions are taken from [&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/customcategories/references_56F06DFD.html&quot; guid=&quot;7.755968586980351E-308&quot;>ROY98&lt;/a>] (q.v.).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;The Software Engineering Process Authority (SEPA)&quot; name=&quot;The Software Engineering Process Authority (SEPA)&quot;>The&#xD;
    Software Engineering Process Authority (SEPA)&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Software Engineering Process Authority (SEPA) facilitates the exchange of information and process guidance both to&#xD;
    and from project practitioners. This role is accountable to the organization general manager for maintaining a current&#xD;
    assessment of the organization's process maturity and its plan for future process improvements. The SEPA must help&#xD;
    initiate and periodically assess project processes. Catalyzing the capture and dissemination of software practices can&#xD;
    be accomplished only when the SEPA understands both the desired improvement and the project context. The SEPA is a&#xD;
    necessary role in any organization. It takes on responsibility and accountability for the process definition and its&#xD;
    maintenance (modification, improvement, technology insertion). The SEPA could be a single individual, the general&#xD;
    manager, or even a team of representatives. The SEPA must truly be an authority, competent and powerful, not a staff&#xD;
    position rendered impotent by ineffective bureaucracy.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;The Project Review Authority (PRA)&quot; name=&quot;The Project Review Authority (PRA)&quot;>The Project Review Authority&#xD;
    (PRA)&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Project Review Authority (PRA) is the organizational entity responsible for ensuring that a software project&#xD;
    complies with all organizational and business unit software policies, practices, and standards. A software project&#xD;
    manager is responsible for meeting the requirements of a contract or some other project compliance standard, and is&#xD;
    also accountable to the PRA. The PRA reviews the project's conformance to contractual obligations and the project's&#xD;
    organizational policy obligations. The customer monitors contract requirements, contract milestones, contract&#xD;
    deliverables, monthly management reviews, progress, quality, cost, schedule, and risk. The PRA reviews customer&#xD;
    commitments as well as adherence to organizational policies, organizational deliverables, financial performance, and&#xD;
    other risks and accomplishments. It is recommended that a single individual be nominated as the PRA; that individual&#xD;
    may delegate the work of monitoring and review as required, and meetings in which the PRA engages may require the&#xD;
    support of others from the development organization's executive management team, so that, at least for the duration of&#xD;
    the meeting, the PRA appears as a team of people. &lt;b>It is strongly recommended however that ultimate authority for&#xD;
    performance should rest with an individual, who calls for support as needed.&lt;/b>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;The Software Engineering Environment Authority (SEEA)&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;The Software Engineering Environment Authority (SEEA)&quot;>The Software Engineering Environment Authority (SEEA)&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Software Engineering Environment Authority (SEEA) is responsible for automating the organization's process,&#xD;
    maintaining the organization's standard environment, training projects to use the environment, and maintaining&#xD;
    organization-wide reusable assets. The SEEA role is necessary to achieve a significant return on investment for a&#xD;
    common process. Tools, techniques, and training can be amortized effectively across multiple projects only if someone&#xD;
    in the organization (the SEEA) is responsible for supporting and administering a standard environment. In many cases,&#xD;
    the environment may be augmented, customized, or modified, but the existence of an 80% default solution for each&#xD;
    project is critical to achieving institutionalization of the organization's process and a good ROI on capital tool&#xD;
    investments.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Infrastructure&quot; name=&quot;Infrastructure&quot;>Infrastructure&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An organization's infrastructure provides human resources support, project-independent research and development, and&#xD;
    other capital software engineering assets. The infrastructure for any given software line of business can range from&#xD;
    trivial to highly entrenched bureaucracies. The typical components of the organizational infrastructure are as follows:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Project administration: time accounting system; contracts, pricing, terms and conditions; corporate information&#xD;
        systems integration&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Engineering skill centers: custom tools repository and maintenance, bid and proposal support, independent research&#xD;
        and development&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Professional development: internal training boot camp, personnel recruiting, personnel skills database maintenance,&#xD;
        literature and assets library, technical publications.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
