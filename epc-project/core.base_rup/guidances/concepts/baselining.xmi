    A baseline is a 'snapshot' in time of one version of each work product in the project repository. It provides an&#xD;
    official standard on which subsequent work is to be based, and to which only authorized changes can be made. After an&#xD;
    initial baseline is established every subsequent change to a baseline is recorded as a delta until the next baseline is&#xD;
    set.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Developers on joining a project populate their work areas with versions of directories and files represented by a&#xD;
    baseline. As work proceeds, a baseline incorporates work that developers have delivered since the last baseline was&#xD;
    created. Once changes have been incorporated into a baseline, developers rebase to the new baseline to stay current&#xD;
    with changes in the project. Rebasing merges files from the integration workspace into the development workspace.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The three main reasons for creating baselines are reproducibility, traceability, and reporting.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Reproducibility is the ability to go back in time and reproduce a given release of a software system, or reproduce a&#xD;
    development environment at a prior time in the project. Traceability establishes the predecessor-successor relationship&#xD;
    between project work products. Its purpose is to ensure that design fulfills requirements, code implements the design,&#xD;
    and executable programs are built from the correct code. Reporting is based on comparing the contents of one baseline&#xD;
    against another. Baseline comparison assists in debugging and generating release notes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When baselines are created, all constituent elements and baselines need to be labeled such that they are uniquely&#xD;
    identifiable and re-creatable.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several advantages to creating baselines:&lt;a id=&quot;XE_baseline__advantages_of_creating&quot;&#xD;
    name=&quot;XE_baseline__advantages_of_creating&quot;>&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A baseline provides a stable point, and a snapshot of the development work products.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Baselines provide a stable point from which new projects can be created. The new project, as a separate branch,&#xD;
        would be isolated from subsequent changes to the original project (on the main branch).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Individual developers can take baselined elements as a basis for updates in their isolated private workspaces.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A baseline provides a way for a team to roll back changes in case the updates are considered to be unstable or&#xD;
        suspect.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A baseline provide a way to reproduce reported bugs given that you can recreate the configuration when a particular&#xD;
        release was built.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Make baselines regularly to make sure that developers stay in sync with each other's work. However, during the course&#xD;
    of the project baselines should be created routinely at the ends of iterations (minor milestones) and major milestones&#xD;
    associated with the end of the lifecycle phases:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lifecycle Objectives Milestone (Inception Phase)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Lifecycle Architecture Milestone (Elaboration Phase)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Initial Operational Capability Milestone (Construction Phase)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Product Release Milestone (Transition Phase)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
