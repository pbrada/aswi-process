    Some key practices used to implement a new development environment, consisting of the Rational Unified Process together&#xD;
    with tools, are:&#xD;

    &lt;a id=&quot;Assess&quot; name=&quot;Assess&quot;>Assess&lt;/a> the Project and the Organization&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Assess the current state of the project and the organization to better understand what parts of the environment you&#xD;
    should improve. You will also better understand how to implement the environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;

&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Implement&quot; name=&quot;Implement&quot;>Implement&lt;/a> Process and Tools Incrementally&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Implement the environment, process, and tools incrementally so people on the projects won't be overwhelmed by many new&#xD;
    factors all at once.&amp;nbsp;By implementing the environment incrementally, it's possible to focus on a subset of the&#xD;
    environment, which increases the probability of success.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Introduce the environment one piece at a time. The result of the development organization assessment helps decide which&#xD;
    parts of the process and which tools you should start to introduce. Normally, focus on those areas where the&#xD;
    development organization has its biggest problems.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Incrementally implementing the environment might mean that in a first, or inception, iteration, you focus on&#xD;
    introducing the Requirements discipline together with the Requirements tools. In the second iteration, the focus is on&#xD;
    introducing the Analysis &amp;amp; Design discipline together with its modeling tools. In subsequent iterations, more and&#xD;
    more parts of the environment are introduced.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Manage&quot; name=&quot;Manage&quot;>Manage&lt;/a> and Plan&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Manage and plan the environment tasks just as you would with all other tasks in the software development project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Implementing a new process and new tools on a project is a complex task. Changing the way people work can jeopardize&#xD;
    the success of a project. Experience shows that when compared to the development tasks, the environment tasks are&#xD;
    sometimes overlooked by the project manager.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The environment tasks must be managed and planned like all other tasks in a software development project. Therefore,&#xD;
    it's important that the project manager has a good understanding of the new process and tools. Sometimes it's difficult&#xD;
    for the project manager to allocate the necessary time to learn about both a new process and potentially several new&#xD;
    tools. In that case, the project manager needs support from someone who knows both how to implement the environment and&#xD;
    who has previously been involved in doing so. Even if the project manager has the right set of skills and experience,&#xD;
    we recommend that you involve &quot;environment-implementation expertise&quot;, as it greatly increases the chances for the&#xD;
    project to succeed.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    See the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/capabilitypatterns/project_management_FC6669AF.html&quot;&#xD;

    software development project, including the environment tasks. Also see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Use Mentors&quot; name=&quot;Use Mentors&quot;>Use Mentors&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Use mentors to introduce a new process in a project.&amp;nbsp;Experience shows that using mentors is crucial if you want&#xD;
    the implementation of a new process to succeed. If you don't have mentors, there's a clear risk that the people on the&#xD;
    project will fall back into their old habits. The mentor acts as a driver of change.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The project needs both the resources and the budget for mentoring on the project. The occurrence of some mentoring&#xD;
    activities need to be planned, such as leading workshops. It's important that the process mentor understands the&#xD;
    significance of being a change driver and makes sure that the work progresses. It's also important that the mentor&#xD;
    becomes dispensable and that there is an end to it, therefore, the mentor needs to transfer both knowledge and&#xD;
    responsibilities to members of the project. See &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/concepts/mentoring_8E4A53E6.html&quot; guid=&quot;2.286278731446181E-305&quot;>Concept: Mentoring&lt;/a>&#xD;
    for more details on what a mentor is and what a mentor does.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Transfer&quot; name=&quot;Transfer&quot;>Distribute&lt;/a> Process Ownership&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Distribute the ownership for the process among the people on the project because they're more likely to adopt and learn&#xD;
    the new process faster. The resulting development case is better when the &quot;real experts&quot;, those people on the project,&#xD;
    develop it themselves. If you distribute the ownership for the process, it will also reduce the likelihood of the&#xD;
    project becoming too heavily dependent on outside consultants.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As soon as possible appoint people on the project to be responsible for each core process discipline. This person has&#xD;
    primary responsibility for configuring that part of the process and the corresponding part of the development case. For&#xD;
    example, being responsible for a core process discipline like requirements, means you're responsible for that part of&#xD;
    the development case. Each person needs to be responsible for one or several core process disciplines, and is someone&#xD;
    who knows the area well and who can mentor other developers. &amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A process engineer acts as mentor to the people on the project who own the different parts of the process and assists&#xD;
    them when they configure the process.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Think&quot; name=&quot;Think&quot;>Think&lt;/a> 'Return-On-Investment'&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Think 'return-on-investment' when you configure the process: focus on those things that will pay back more than the&#xD;
    investment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Experience shows that some projects tend to spend too much time and resources developing extensive guidelines, an&#xD;
    extensive development case, and additional process-related material. There are three major problems with this:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul class=&quot;ck&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        People do not read extensive descriptions.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Doing everything right from the beginning is very difficult. It's better to do something less extensive, try it&#xD;
        out, and then adjust it.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        It removes the focus from mentoring. People with process knowledge need to have mentoring, not writing extensive&#xD;
        descriptions, assigned as their primary task.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When developing guidelines, you need to keep in mind the return-on-investment. Try to reuse existing guidelines. For&#xD;
    example, a cost-efficient alternative to developing a complete use-case modeling guideline is to let a good example of&#xD;
    an existing use-case description serve as the Use-Case Modeling Guidelines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In practice, you can't measure the investment and the pay-back, then compare the two. As a process engineer, the most&#xD;
    important thing to always keep in mind is that whatever you do, it must have a substantial pay back for the developers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;KeepPeopleInformed&quot; name=&quot;KeepPeopleInformed&quot;>Keep&lt;/a> People Informed and Involved&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Keep people informed about the new process and tools, and have them involved in the work because the greatest threat to&#xD;
    any change in an organization is peoples' attitudes towards the change. Introducing a new process and tools in any&#xD;
    organization means that people have to change the way they work. People have a natural resistance toward change.&#xD;
    There's always the risk of falling into a negative spiral, where people's negative attitudes lead to poorer results&#xD;
    which then lead to even more negative attitudes.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The following lists some actions you can take that may help prevent negative attitudes from forming among people in the&#xD;
    organization:&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Set realistic expectations. Do not oversell the new process or the new tools.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Involve key people in the change work. Let them be part of the pilot project and give them responsibility for parts&#xD;
        of the process. See &lt;a href=&quot;#Transfer&quot;>Distribute Process Ownership&lt;/a>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Explain why the change needs to be done. What problems does the organization have that need to be solved? What&#xD;
        changes in technology require a new process and new tools? How will you benefit from using these new tools and&#xD;
        process?&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Inform all people in the organization about what is happening. For example, keep all departments informed about&#xD;
        what is going on. This information doesn't have to be in very great detail; the important thing is that they&#xD;
        receive some information.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Remember stakeholders, such as customers or sponsors. For example, if you change from a more waterfall-like&#xD;
        development approach to an iterative development approach, the stakeholders must understand how an iterative&#xD;
        development project is managed and how progress is measured. In an iterative development project, for example, they&#xD;
        can't expect a completely frozen design at an early milestone. They would also be affected when projects change the&#xD;
        way they capture requirements.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Train&quot; name=&quot;Train&quot;>Educate&lt;/a> People&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Educate people&amp;nbsp;about the new process and the new tools because they need to understand both the new process and&#xD;
    how to use the new tools.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    There are several ways to educate people, including the following methods that have been used:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Standard training courses&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Boot-camps&quot; consisting of one to five weeks of concentrated, hands-on training. Not many organizations can afford&#xD;
        boot-camps, however, they have proven to be efficient if there are many new factors for the people in the&#xD;
        project.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Mentoring works when you have a mentor who reviews results, leads workshops, and answers questions. Done well,&#xD;
        mentoring can be a very efficient way to transfer knowledge.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &quot;Kick-start&quot; workshops are an efficient way to get the people up-to-speed in a day when introducing a new part of&#xD;
        the environment. In this type of workshop, people work using their real project material and following the new&#xD;
        parts of the development case using the new templates, guidelines, and tools. Typically, a process engineer and a&#xD;
        tool specialist would be responsible for this workshop. Do not spend a lot of time developing training material for&#xD;
        a kick-start workshop. The main purpose is to give hands-on experience using new sections of the development case&#xD;
        together with templates, guidelines, and tools. The kick-start workshop is also a way to verify the development&#xD;
        case, templates, guidelines, and tools.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&lt;br />&#xD;
