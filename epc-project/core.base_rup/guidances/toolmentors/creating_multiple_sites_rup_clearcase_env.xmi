&lt;h3>&#xD;
    What does ClearCase MultiSite do for your company?&#xD;
&lt;/h3>The ClearCase MultiSite product is an add-on product to ClearCase used to distribute software development across&#xD;
different geographical locations. For example, if your company has developers in Boston, San Francisco, and Bangalore, you&#xD;
can give every developer local, real-time access to the source code repository (the versioned object base, or VOB). With&#xD;
MultiSite, each site has its own copy (replica) of the VOB and all developers can work in parallel on the source files&#xD;
without collisions.&amp;nbsp; &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Conflicting changes at different sites are prevented by ClearCase MultiSite's mastership scheme. Most ClearCase objects&#xD;
    can be mastered by only one replica, and only those developers who use that replica can modify the object. MultiSite&#xD;
    has facilities you can use to share control of source code elements so multiple developers can work on the same source&#xD;
    file in turn.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Instead of &quot;throwing changes over the wall&quot;, you can use the synchronization tools supplied with ClearCase MultiSite to&#xD;
    send changes among replicas as often as site connectivity allows. If you have IP connections, you can use MultiSite's&#xD;
    shipping mechanism and configurable scripts to synchronize replicas frequently and automatically, giving developers at&#xD;
    other sites access to the very latest changes made at your site. If you do not have IP connections, you can choose&#xD;
    another synchronization method (for example, electronic mail, ftp, or magnetic tape) that's appropriate to your&#xD;
    configuration.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Do you need ClearCase MultiSite?&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    You should consider using ClearCase and ClearCase MultiSite if you need to distribute development among several&#xD;
    different locations and it's impractical for developers to remotely access VOBs. An additional benefit to using&#xD;
    MultiSite is that you can use it as a backup mechanism by creating a replica in a different region at your site and&#xD;
    synchronizing it frequently with the primary replica. By backing up the secondary replica instead of the primary&#xD;
    replica, you can allow development to continue unhindered in the primary replica. Also, if the primary replica's host&#xD;
    has a catastrophic disk crash, you can put the backup replica into use to avoid development downtime.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
