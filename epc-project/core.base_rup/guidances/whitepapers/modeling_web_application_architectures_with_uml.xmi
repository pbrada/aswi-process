&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    Web applications are becoming increasingly complex and mission-critical. To help manage this complexity, they need to
    be modeled. UML is the standard language for modeling software-intensive systems. When attempting to model Web
    applications with UML, it becomes apparent that some of its components don't fit nicely into standard UML modeling
    elements. To stick with one modeling notation for the entire system (Web components and traditional middle tier
    components), UML must be extended. This paper presents an extension to the UML using its formal extension mechanism.
    The extension is designed so that Web-specific components can be integrated with the rest of the system's model, and to
    exhibit the proper level of abstraction and detail for suitable for designers, implementers, and architects of Web
    applications.
