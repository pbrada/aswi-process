    Abstract
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    This paper presents an overview of content management, particularly as it relates to delivering content on the Web.
    Content management represents a collection of tools and methods that are used together to collect, process, and deliver
    diverse types of content.&amp;nbsp;The scope of content management is broad, and its challenges are many.&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Collecting and processing content intended for a Web site is a more complex and time-sensitive process than many legacy
    document management systems are designed to handle. Organizations have turned to the Web as a means of delivering
    information to, and communicating with, their customers; however, simply uploading content to a Web site does not mean
    it will reach the proper people or that it will meet their information needs.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Content management projects entail far more than buying or building an application that provides content workflow. The
    development of a content management solution is a group of related software projects-made up of database, production
    workflow, content delivery, and Web applications-making it a perfect candidate for an established software development
    framework such as RUP.&amp;nbsp;
