    Abstract
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>
    A number of techniques exist for decomposing software systems. Layering is one example and is described in this paper.
    Such techniques address two main concerns: most systems are too complex to comprehend in their entirety, and different
    perspectives of a system are required for different audiences.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    Layering has been adopted in numerous software systems, and is espoused in many texts and also in the Rational Unified
    Process (RUP). However, layering is often misunderstood and incorrectly applied. This paper clarifies what is meant be
    layering, and discusses the impact of applying different layering strategies.
