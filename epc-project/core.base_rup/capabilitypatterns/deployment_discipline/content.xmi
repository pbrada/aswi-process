    A beta test gives the product a controlled, real-world test, so that feedback from potential users can be used to shape&#xD;
    the final product.&amp;nbsp; It also provides a preview of the next release to interested customers.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    It is most appropriate in situations where the product being built is unprecedented or where the product will be&#xD;
    shrink-wrapped and made available for sale commercially.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Feedback from the Beta Program is treated as Stakeholder Requests and factored into the developing product features in&#xD;
    subsequent iterations.&#xD;

    This work is generally performed in the construction and transition phases, although there may be situations where it&#xD;
    is useful to perform it as early as the elaboration phase. It is typical for beta testing to be the primary focus for&#xD;
    iterations in which it is conducted,&amp;nbsp; As such this activity will typically be preceded by integration and build&#xD;
    activities focused on enabling the beta test work. This activity itself will typically begin part-way into the&#xD;
    iteration and may continue until the end of the iteration.&#xD;

    A deployment manager needs to be someone who is aware of the operational needs of the end user and capable of pulling
    together all the items that go in to making the product. The deployment manager runs the beta test and, in the case of
    &quot;shrink wrap&quot; products, deals with the manufacturers to ensure that adequate quality is achieved in the product.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The deployment manager gets the product delivered and, as such, needs to be well versed in the required infrastructure
    and user needs to ensure that the product is available for the users.

    The appeal of the Internet as a software distribution channel is obvious. The product is entirely accessible through&#xD;
    the software environment via browsers and Web sites. The challenge for the provider is to make sure the product is&#xD;
    reliably available at all times to a global marketplace, even through varying conditions that could choke the host&#xD;
    hardware and communication bandwidths.&#xD;

    Setting up the hardware infrastructure to host the corporate Web presence is beyond the scope of a software development
    process. However, the deployment manager needs to know how to add the product offering to the list of products
    available over the Web and ensure that the product is available for purchase and delivery on demand.

    Deployment planning requires a high degree of customer collaboration and preparation. A successful conclusion to a&#xD;
    software project can be severely impacted by factors &lt;i>outside the scope of software development&lt;/i> such as the&#xD;
    building, hardware infrastructure not being in place, and the staff being ill-prepared for changing to the new system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    To ensure successful deployment and transition to the new system and ways of doing business, the Deployment Plan needs&#xD;
    to address not only the deliverable software, but also the development of training material and system support material&#xD;
    to ensure that end users can successfully use the delivered software product.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is performed early in each iteration, generally starting late in the construction phase and continuing&#xD;
    through transition. It can begin as soon as iteration planning is reasonably complete for the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This task is recommended whenever an executable release will be externally deployed outside the primary development&#xD;
    team, either for the purposes of delivering the software to the end user, or for testing purposes.&#xD;

    To explain the work involved in the Deployment discipline, the activities and work products are organized into a&#xD;
    capability pattern for the discipline.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deployment is about making the software product available to the end-user and is the culmination of the software&#xD;
    development effort.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Deployment planning (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/capabilitypatterns/plan_deployment_C83CF0FB.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{9B5E6B08-625F-40DF-AA4E-0BD056C0553A}&quot;>Activity: Plan Deployment&lt;/a>) starts early in the project lifecycle and&#xD;
    addresses not only the production of the deliverable software, but also the development of training material and system&#xD;
    support material to ensure that the end-user can successfully use the delivered software product.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Support material (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;{3124AE63-F6A4-48E9-A517-E484845B9F09}&quot;>Activity: Develop Support Material&lt;/a>)&amp;nbsp;covers the full range of&#xD;
    information that will be required by the end-user to install, operate, use and maintain the delivered system. It also&#xD;
    includes training material for all the various positions that will be required to effectively use the new system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Discipline places a great emphasis on ensuring the product is well tested prior to its release to the&#xD;
    customer base. The&amp;nbsp;activity Manage Acceptance Test&amp;nbsp;covers to two kinds of test environments. Firstly, the&#xD;
    build needs to be sufficiently tested in the development test environment (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/capabilitypatterns/manage_acceptance_test_3F0A2A1D.html&quot; guid=&quot;_tASIQDK7EdqseP6pgOfC6g&quot;>Activity:&#xD;
    Manage Acceptance Test&lt;/a>), and then re-tested at the target site (&lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/capabilitypatterns/manage_acceptance_test_for_custom_install_60E767DE.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_64Ee0DK4EdqHc6VRvq68Uw&quot;>Activity: Manage Acceptance Test for Custom Install&lt;/a>). The 'test environment' should&#xD;
    be an 'instance' of the target environment.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once the product has been tested at the development site it needs to be prepared for delivery to the customer. The&#xD;
    release can created for the purposes of beta-testing, a test deployment to the final users, or depending on it level of&#xD;
    maturity for the final product. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    a product release that consists of the software, and the necessary accompanying work products required to effectively&#xD;
    install and use it.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A beta-program refers to the process used by an organization to solicit feedback from a subset of users on products&#xD;
    that are under development. The feedback is used to augment the product. &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;

    <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Deployment Manager organizes the installation of the product on one or more Test Environment Configurations that&#xD;
    represents an environment acceptable to the customer as specified in the Product Acceptance Plan. For acceptance&#xD;
    testing for a custom install, this may actually be the production deployment environment itself.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In some cases, the installation process itself may be subject to an acceptance test, as may any preceding hardware&#xD;
    upgrades and configurations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Once installed, the Tester typically runs through a preselected set of tests, usually based on a selected subset of the&#xD;
    existing Test Suites, and determines the Test Results. The Deployment Manager and other stakeholders review the Test&#xD;
    Results for anomalies. If there are &quot;show stoppers&quot;, the Deployment Manager raises Change Requests that require&#xD;
    immediate attention and resolution, and may delay or postpone subsequent plans for deployment to a wider user base.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is generally performed in Transition, when the product is ready to release to the customer.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that when acceptance testing is performed, the formality of that testing will differ to suit the project&#xD;
    context.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></usageGuidance>
    <howtoStaff>A Deployment Manager needs to be someone who is aware of the operational needs of the end user and capable of enabling a
valid assessment of the product in a suitable environment. Pulling together all the many items, events and resources
required for a successful acceptance test requires exceptional planning and organizational skills.</howtoStaff>

    This work is generally performed in Construction and Transition, typically starting later into construction. In some&#xD;
    exceptional cases, acceptance testing may be useful in Elaboration iterations. Within an iteration, it is typically&#xD;
    conducted later in the iteration on a more mature software build.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    Note that when acceptance testing is performed, the formality of that testing will differ to suit the project context.&#xD;
