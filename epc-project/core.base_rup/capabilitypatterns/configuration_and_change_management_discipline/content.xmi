    This work is done by making sure the essential artifacts are available to developers and integrators in the various&#xD;
    private and public workspaces as they need them, and then are adequately baselined and stored for subsequent use.&#xD;
    Setting up the CM environment involves creating the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    Typically this work starts in Inception and continues throughout the lifecycle. Generally this work is most prevalent&#xD;
    in iterations at the very beginning of each phase (or at the end of each preceding phase) to prepare a suitable CM&#xD;
    environment for the forthcoming phase. Note that the requirements for a CM environment often change from phase-to-phase&#xD;
    as the team size expands and contracts: a smaller development team in early phases normally requires a less formal&#xD;
    environment than is required in later phases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is not considered optional, although project culture will mean this work will vary from being a small&#xD;
    consideration to a large endeavor. Note that where an existing CM environment is in place, this work may be more&#xD;
    focused on tailoring that environment to suit the project or lifecycle phase.&#xD;

&lt;p>
    To set up an appropriate environment, a person playing the Configuration Manager role needs to have a good
    understanding of the component structures of the overall product, and will need to work closely with the &lt;a
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;resources/rup_software_architect,{4AC346F0-E6FC-4D2C-8410-2EDF8DDDC91D}.html&quot;

    are established.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    A person playing the Integrator role in this work needs to ensure that artifacts delivered from the developer
    workspaces are sufficiently tested such that they can be incorporated into a testable build. The Integrator role needs
    to be familiar with Project CM Policies, Build and Test Practices.

    The activity focuses on:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Establishing project configuration management policies&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Establishing policies and processes for controlling product change&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Documenting this information in the Configuration Management Plan (included in Software Development Plan)&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    CM policies refer to the ability to identify, safeguard and report on the artifacts that have been approved for use in&#xD;
    a project. Identification is simplified and enabled through the use of proper tools to control project artifacts, and&#xD;
    the systematic labeling of those artifacts over time to identify their relative maturity and their relationships with&#xD;
    each other at given points in time. Systematic identification practices are a key enabler for the safeguarding of&#xD;
    project artifacts through archiving and baselining techniques.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Standard, documented change control processes help to ensure that changes are made within a project in a consistent&#xD;
    manner, and the appropriate stakeholders are informed of the current state of the product, requested changes to it and&#xD;
    the impact of these changes on cost, schedule and so forth.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The CM Plan documents how product related CM activities are to be planned, implemented controlled and organized.&#xD;

    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is primarily performed in the first iterations in each phase. While most important in the Construction and&#xD;
    Transition phases, this work may be important in the Elaboration and even Inception phase, depending on project&#xD;
    culture.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This work is not considered optional, although it will differ in format, style and level of ceremony to suit the&#xD;
    project context. Note also that the rigidity and formality of the change process tend to change increase over the life&#xD;
    of the project, typically becoming most formal and rigid in the Transition phase.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></usageGuidance>
    <howtoStaff>&lt;a id=&quot;HowToStaff&quot; name=&quot;HowToStaff&quot;>&lt;/a> 
&lt;p>
    A person playing the Configuration Manager role needs to be organized by nature, yet flexible enough to plan
    configuration and change control to suit the needs of the project team. The Configuration Manager role supports the
    team by ensuring that the project change policies are reflected within the projects change management tools, enabling
    software developers to easily transition artifacts through state changes in accordance with the defined development and
    approval practices. The Configuration Manager role is required to put measures in place to monitor that the CM Plan is
    being followed as intended, that audit reporting is occurring on a regular basis, and to work with the System
    Administrator role to ensure that backups of CM assets are in safekeeping (e.g. fireproof safe for backup sets on-site,
    weekly backup sets stored off-site).
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Change Control Manager is a key arbitration role. In this capacity, the decision for the inclusion of any given
    change in a software build is ultimately made by the Change Control Manager on a project. In practice, only those
    changes of significant potential impact typically warrant monitoring, and any potential impact on the inclusion-or
    exclusion-of changes to the product should be carefully considered with regard to project factors such as the political
    climate, the need to establish trust between developer and customer and so forth.

    The frequency and formality in which baselines are created are described in the CM Plan. The degree of formality is&#xD;
    clearly much higher for a product being released to a customer than for executable releases within the internal project&#xD;
    team. When the combined set of artifacts reach certain stages or levels of maturity, baselines are created to assist&#xD;
    managing availability for release, reuse and so forth.&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>
    <usageGuidance>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Typically this work starts in Elaboration, though it is most prevalent in the Construction and Transition phases. In&#xD;
    some cases there may be value in baselining Inception artifacts, but this is not the general case. Multiple baselines&#xD;
    may be created and managed within a single iteration and may happen at any stage during the iteration.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    As a general rule, this work is optional if an executable release does not need to be externally delivered outside the&#xD;
    core development team.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;p>
    This work is primarily driven by the Configuration Manager role, where the typical need is to be able to assemble a
    product for release. The released product requires a Bill of Materials (BOM) that serves as a complete checklist of
    what is to be delivered to the customer. The released product will inevitably require release notes and training
    material as described in the Deployment activities.
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
    The Integrator role contributes to this work by ensuring that artifacts delivered from the developer workspaces are
    integrated such that they can be incorporated into a independently testable build. The person playing the Integrator

    While this work starts in Inception and continues throughout the lifecycle, it tends to gain importance as the&#xD;
