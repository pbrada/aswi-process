&lt;p>&#xD;
    Capabilities Patterns express and communicate process knowledge for a key area of interest such as a Discipline&#xD;
    or&amp;nbsp;a practice and can be directly used by process practitioners to guide their work.&amp;nbsp; They are also used as&#xD;
    building blocks to assemble &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_concepts/guidances/concepts/delivery_process_CFEBBC78.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_EhgqwO8MEdmKSqa_gSYthg&quot;>Delivery Processes&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;or larger Capability Patterns ensuring optimal reuse and&#xD;
    application of the key practices they express.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples for Capability Pattern could be 'use case-based requirements management', 'use case analysis', or 'unit&#xD;
    testing'. Typically but not necessarily, Capability Patterns have the scope of one Discipline providing a breakdown of&#xD;
    reusable complex Activities, relationships to the Roles which perform Tasks within these Activities, as well as to the&#xD;
    Work Products that are used and produced.&amp;nbsp; Generally, a Capability Pattern does not relate to any specific phase&#xD;
    or iteration of a development lifecycle, and should not imply any.&amp;nbsp; In other words, a pattern should be designed&#xD;
    in a way that it is applicable anywhere in a Delivery Process.&amp;nbsp; This enables its Activities to be flexibly&#xD;
    assigned to whatever phases there are in the Delivery Process to which it is being applied.&amp;nbsp; An exception to this&#xD;
    would be capability patterns that are intended to provide a template for quickly creating an iteration or portion of an&#xD;
    iteration for a particular phase in a Delivery Process.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;br />&#xD;
     Key applications&amp;nbsp;or areas of reuse for Capability Patterns are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To serve as building blocks for assembling Delivery Processes or larger Capability Patterns.&amp;nbsp; Normally&#xD;
        developing a Delivery Process is not done from scratch but by systematically applying and binding patterns.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To support direct execution in a development project that does not work following a well-defined process, but works&#xD;
        based on loosely connected process fragments of practices in a flexible manner (for example, Agile Development).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        To support process education by describing knowledge for a key area such as practices on how to perform the work&#xD;
        for a Discipline (for example, Requirements Management), for a specific development technique (aspect-oriented&#xD;
        development), or a specific technical area (for example, relational database design), which is used for education&#xD;
        and teaching.&lt;br />&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The workflow of a Capability Pattern is usually represented using the UML Activity Diagram notation.&amp;nbsp;&#xD;
