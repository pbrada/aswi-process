  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Artifacts are tangible well-defined Work Products consumed, produced, or modified by Tasks.&amp;nbsp; Artifacts may be&#xD;
    composed of other Artifacts. For example, a model Artifact can be composed of model elements, which are also Artifacts.&#xD;
    They may serve as a basis for defining Reusable Assets.&amp;nbsp; Roles use Artifacts to perform Tasks and produce&#xD;
    Artifacts in the course of performing Tasks.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Artifacts are the responsibility of a single Role, making responsibility easy to identify and understand, and promoting&#xD;
    the idea that every piece of information produced in the method requires the appropriate set of skills. Even though one&#xD;
    Role might &quot;own&quot; a specific type of Artifact, other Roles can still use the Artifacts, and perhaps even update them if&#xD;
    the Role has been given permission to do so.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    &lt;b>Artifacts&amp;nbsp;are generally &lt;i>not&lt;/i> documents&lt;/b>. Many methods have an excessive focus on documents, and in&#xD;
    particular on &lt;i>paper documentation&lt;/i>. The most efficient and pragmatic approach to managing project Artifacts is to&#xD;
    maintain&amp;nbsp;them &lt;i>within&lt;/i> the appropriate tool used to create and manage them. When necessary, one may generate&#xD;
    documents (snapshots) from these tools, on a just-in-time basis.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Examples Artifacts:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A use case specification stored in Microsoft&amp;reg; Word&amp;reg;&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A design model stored in Rational Software Architect.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A project plan stored in Microsoft&amp;reg; Project&amp;reg;.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A defect stored in Rational ClearQuest.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        A project requirements database in Rational RequisitePro.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note also that formats such as on &lt;b>whiteboards&lt;/b> or &lt;b>flip charts&lt;/b> can be used to capture pictorial information&#xD;
    such as UML diagrams, tabular information such as short lists of status information or even textual information such as&#xD;
    short vision statements. These formats work well for smaller, collocated teams where all team members have ready access&#xD;
    to these resources.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    However, there are still Artifacts which either have to be or are best suited to being plain text documents, as in the&#xD;
    case of external input to the project, or in some cases where it is simply the best means of presenting descriptive&#xD;
    information. Where possible, teams should consider using collaborative &lt;b>Work Group&lt;/b> tools, such as WikiWiki webs&#xD;
    or Groove to capture textual documentation electronically, thus simplifying ongoing content and version management.&#xD;
    This is especially of importance where historic records must be maintained for purposes such as fulfilling audit&#xD;
    requirements. For any nontrivial development effort, especially where large development teams are involved, Work&#xD;
    Products &lt;strong>are&lt;/strong> &lt;strong>most likely to be subject to version control and configuration&#xD;
    management.&lt;/strong> This is sometimes only achieved by versioning the container Work Product, when it is not possible&#xD;
    to do it for the elementary, contained Work Products. For example, in software development, you may control the&#xD;
    versions of a whole design model, or design package, and not the individual classes they contain.&#xD;
