&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Definition&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Task describes a unit of work. Every Task is performed by specific Roles. The granularity of a Task is generally a&#xD;
    few hours to a few days. It usually affects one or only a small number of Work Products. Tasks are not necessarily used&#xD;
    as&amp;nbsp;a basis for planning and tracking progress - they are often too fine-grained for that purpose; Activity&#xD;
    groupings of Tasks are often the better units for planning and tracking.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Task has a clear purpose, usually expressed in terms of creating or updating some Work Products, such as models,&#xD;
    classes, or&amp;nbsp;plans. Within a Task, each performing Role achieves a well defined goal. A Task provides complete&#xD;
    step-by-step explanations of doing all the work required to achieve this goal. This description is complete,&#xD;
    independent of when in a process lifecycle the work would actually be done. Therefore, it does not describe when you do&#xD;
    what work at what point of time, but describes all the work that gets done throughout the development lifecycle that&#xD;
    contributes to the achievement of the Tasks' goal.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    When a Task is being applied in a Process, a reference object defined as Task Descriptor provides information, which&#xD;
    includes what elements of the Task will actually be performed at that point in time. This assumes that a Task will&#xD;
    usually be performed in the Process over and over again, but each time with a slightly different emphasis on different&#xD;
    steps or aspects of the Task description&amp;nbsp;as well as perhaps different or additional performing roles or different&#xD;
    input/output (also refer to &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_concepts/guidances/concepts/introduction_to_uma_931F5B93.html&quot; guid=&quot;_94_eoO8LEdmKSqa_gSYthg&quot;>Key&#xD;
    Capabilities of the Unified Method Architecture (UMA)&lt;/a> for the difference between Method Content and Process).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Steps&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Tasks can be broken down into sections of Steps. A Step describes a meaningful and consistent part of the overall work&#xD;
    described for a Task. Steps fall into three main categories:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Thinking&lt;/b> Steps: where the individual performing the Role understands the nature of the Task, gathers and&#xD;
        examines the input Work Products, and formulates the result.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Performing&lt;/b> Steps: where the individual performing the Role creates or updates some Work Products.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;b>Reviewing&lt;/b> Steps: where the individual performing the Role inspects the results against some criteria.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Not all Steps are necessarily performed each time a Task is invoked, so they can be expressed in the form of alternate&#xD;
    flows (similar to Use Cases).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    Examples&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    A Typical Task&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Task such as &quot;Develop Use-Case Model&quot; in RUP describes all the work that needs to be done to develop a complete&#xD;
    use-case model. This would consist of the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The identification and naming of use cases and actors&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The writing of a brief description&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The modeling of use cases and their relationships in diagrams&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The detailed description of a basic flow&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The detailed description of alternative flows&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Performing of walkthroughs, workshops and reviews, etc.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    All of these parts contribute to the development goal of developing the use case model, but the parts will be performed&#xD;
    at different points in time in a Process. Identification, naming, and brief descriptions would be performed early in a&#xD;
    typical development Process versus the writing of detailed alternative flows which would be performed much later. All&#xD;
    these parts or Steps within the same Task define the &quot;method&quot; of developing a use-case model. Applying such a method in&#xD;
    a lifecycle is defining which Steps are done when going from one iteration to the next.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    A Task and its Steps&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    The Task &quot;Find Use Cases and Actors&quot; in RUP decomposes into the following Steps:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;blockquote>&#xD;
    &lt;blockquote>&#xD;
        &lt;ol>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Find actors&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Find use cases&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Describe how actors interact with use cases&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Package use cases and actors&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Present the use-case model in use-case diagrams&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Develop a survey of the use-case model&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
            &lt;li>&#xD;
                Evaluate your results&#xD;
            &lt;/li>&#xD;
        &lt;/ol>&#xD;
    &lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;/blockquote>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;example&quot;>&#xD;
    The finding part [Steps 1 to 3] requires some thinking; the performing part [Steps 4 to 6] involves capturing the&#xD;
    result in the use-case model; the reviewing part [Step 7] is where the individual performing the Role evaluates the&#xD;
    result to assess completeness, robustness, intelligibility, or other qualities.&#xD;
