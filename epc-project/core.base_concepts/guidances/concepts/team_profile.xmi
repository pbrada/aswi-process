  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    Work assignments and Work Product responsibilities can be different from Activity to Activity in a development project.&#xD;
    Different phases require different staffing profiles, that is, different skills and resources doing different types of&#xD;
    work. Therefore, a Process needs to define these profiles in a flexible manner. Whereas Core Method Content defines&#xD;
    standard responsibilities and assignments, a Process expressed in breakdown structures needs to be able to refine and&#xD;
    redefine these throughout its definition.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Role Descriptors, Composite Roles, as well as Team Profiles provide the data structure necessary to achieve this&#xD;
    flexibility and to provide&amp;nbsp;Process users with the capability to define different teams and Role relationships for&#xD;
    every Activity (including Activities on any nesting level as well as Iterations or Phases). Hence, in addition to the&#xD;
    work breakdown and Work Product breakdown structures, Team Profiles are used to define a third type of breakdown&#xD;
    structure: The Team Breakdown Structure. It is created as an Activity specific hierarchy of Team Profiles comprising of&#xD;
    Role Descriptors and Composite Roles. These structures can be presented as Org-Charts.&lt;br />&#xD;
