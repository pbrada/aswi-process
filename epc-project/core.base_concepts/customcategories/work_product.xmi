    A Work Product is an abstract concept which provides a generalization for the concrete work product types &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_concepts/guidances/concepts/artifact_11B6E73F.html&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_lBgkMBUJEdqrUt4zetC1gg&quot;>Deliverable&lt;/a>. Work Product descriptions actually represents work product types, i.e.&#xD;
    an instance of Work Product is a description of a specific type of work product and not an individual work product&#xD;
    instance.&amp;nbsp; However, for simplicity reasons and because of low risk of misinterpretation we did not append the word&#xD;
    'type' to every element in UMA.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Work Product is an abstraction for descriptions of content elements that are used to define anything used, produced,&#xD;
    or modified by a task.&amp;nbsp; Roles use Work Products to perform Tasks and produce Work Products in the course of&#xD;
    performing Tasks.&amp;nbsp; Work Products are the responsibility of a single Role, making responsibility easy to identify&#xD;
    and understand, and promoting the idea that every piece of information produced in the method requires the appropriate&#xD;
    set of skills. Even though one Role might &quot;own&quot; a specific type of Work Products, other Roles can still use the Work&#xD;
    Products; perhaps even update them if the Role has been given permission to do so.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Note that Work Product is the term used to describe what other processes denote using terms such as Artifact, work&#xD;
    unit, and so on. In UMA, Deliverables are only considered to be the subsets of all Work Products that will end up being&#xD;
    delivered into the hands of the customers and users, usually as part of a formal or contractually agreed hand-over.&#xD;
