&lt;p>&#xD;
    This step begins in the inception phase as market research is conducted and general trends within the relevant market&#xD;
    sector are understood. The information is amplified for each COTS package and its vendor as COTS packages are&#xD;
    identified to be included in candidate solutions. In the elaboration phase, the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.cots/workproducts/cots_package_dossier_F44E6C04.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{B8F591A5-DA8E-4CC6-A41E-DD522B6C1102}&quot;>COTS Package Dossier&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.cots/workproducts/cots_vendor_dossier_9DDAD3A2.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{E6CEF5C2-2915-48D6-8607-D83489CC101E}&quot;>Vendor Dossier&lt;/a> are updated to reflect those COTS packages that are&#xD;
    included in the selected solution. This information is updated routinely through the construction and transition phases&#xD;
    to help proactively plan COTS package updates throughout the life of the COTS package in the system.&#xD;

    <sectionDescription>&lt;a id=&quot;DevelopStrategyCreateManageVendorRelationships&quot; name=&quot;DevelopStrategyCreateManageVendorRelationships&quot;>&lt;/a> &#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Starting in the inception phase, this strategy is developed and captured in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.cots/workproducts/cots_vendor_management_plan_586DC8AE.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{74F39360-5B26-4133-935F-16124D246454}&quot;>Vendor Management Plan&lt;/a> as part of each candidate solution. The&#xD;
    vendors selected for inclusion are those whose COTS packages play a significant role in the solution. The nature of the&#xD;
    relationship will depend on the leverage the project has or needs to have over COTS package support and upgrades, and&#xD;
    will evolve through the later phases. The plan written in the inception phase is updated in the elaboration phase as&#xD;
    COTS packages are selected. During the construction phase the plan is updated when the vendor support of the COTS&#xD;
    package changes and upgrades to COTS packages occur.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin interacting with vendors and vendor-related user groups in the inception phase. The relationship with each vendor&#xD;
    becomes more directed and involved when the COTS package is selected in the elaboration phase and then continues&#xD;
    through the construction and transition phases as long as the COTS package is part of the solution.&lt;br />&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin establishing and nurturing relationship with other customers in the inception phase and continue through the&#xD;
    transition phase. It is just as important to stay connected with other customers who use the COTS package as it is to&#xD;
    interact directly with the vendor. Lessons in the use of the COTS package can and should be shared. In addition, it is&#xD;
    important to understand the forces that are driving the vendor to make COTS package changes. Unified customers seeking&#xD;
    a particular enhancement are a formidable incentive for the vendor.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    Begin these relationships in the elaboration phase as COTS packages are selected. Close relationships might be critical&#xD;
    to success in the construction phase as COTS packages are integrated into higher-level subsystem components or into the&#xD;
    broader organization's architecture. Where possible, these relationships should be continued in the transition phase to&#xD;
    help resolve COTS package mismatches that occur as part of new COTS package upgrades.&#xD;
