    guid=&quot;{27E37103-8C78-4FA0-8886-2DD1C59FAB80}&quot;>Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description&lt;/a> establishes the&#xD;
    scope, priorities, and topic flow for the evaluation workshop criteria.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each topic within the agenda will have a listing of questions and issues to be covered. The list of detailed issues to&#xD;
    be covered should be consistent with the time allotted to this subject area. The issues and questions will be presented&#xD;
    on an &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../extend.cots/workproducts/cots_eval_score_sheet_79D6F7A.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{2ACB9E5C-E76D-4415-970F-BA7966486C53}&quot;>&lt;font color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;>Evaluation Score Sheet&lt;/font>&lt;/a> where the&#xD;
    evaluation team members will be able to record their impressions as numeric scores and as comments. The vendors will be&#xD;
    expected to cover each question or issue on the scoring sheet to the best of their ability.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A &quot;Confidentiality Statement&quot; should be provided with the Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description . This&#xD;
    agreement protects the acquiring organization since the Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description may include&#xD;
    proprietary material.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The demonstration's rating process should be described for the vendors in the Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop&#xD;
    Description. There should also be an explanation on how questions will be handled. Other assumptions and rules with&#xD;
    regard to the demonstration should be clarified.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A request for a &quot;Reference List&quot; may be included with the Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description along with&#xD;
    other vendor evaluation requirements. The Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description is the artifact, which is&#xD;
    provided to the vendor finalist.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description is delivered to the COTS package vendors upon notification of&#xD;
    participation in the candidate solution evaluation process. The Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description&#xD;
    should be delivered to the vendors on a timely basis to allow maximum preparation time and to enable each vendor to&#xD;
    have the same notification of demonstration content.&#xD;

    a detailed workshop agenda and schedule for each vendor to follow during the presentation of their COTS packages'&#xD;
    capabilities. The dates and a detailed workshop agenda and schedule should be specified for each functional area being&#xD;
    demonstrated by the vendors in an order defined by the Acquirer, to ensure that the critical use cases and critical&#xD;
    nonfunctional requirements are covered. The timed agenda is important to pace the vendors during the workshop to ensure&#xD;
    that all areas being scored are viewed.&#xD;

&lt;p>&#xD;
    The score sheet is used by the evaluators to score the vendor's COTS package demonstration for each item defined in the&#xD;
    &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../extend.cots/workproducts/cots_eval_workshop_description_F87DF664.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{27E37103-8C78-4FA0-8886-2DD1C59FAB80}&quot;>Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description&lt;/a>. The score sheet&#xD;
    facilitates a structured step-by-step flow through the vendor's demonstration of their COTS packages' capabilities.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Include in the score sheet the evaluation workshop agenda and schedule as a reference for both the evaluator and the&#xD;
    vendor. Its purpose is to remind both groups of the amount of time allotted for each demonstration area. Usually, there&#xD;
    is less time than there is function to demonstrate. Consequently, the schedule is included so all are aware of the&#xD;
    amount of time that the vendor has to demonstrate their COTS packages' capabilities in a functional area.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    List in the score sheet the evaluators that are to participate in a given area. It is important to track the&#xD;
    participation of these evaluators so that the same evaluators will score all vendors. The same evaluators must&#xD;
    participate to maintain an objective score. The participants are listed to provide an easy way to track the required&#xD;
    evaluators.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    List in the score sheet time allotted for each functional area. To obtain objective data, each vendor must have the&#xD;
    same time to demonstrate their product. The suggested time is listed so the vendor, with the facilitator's help, can&#xD;
    keep the demonstration on schedule.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Include a sequential numbering system for process area and functional area to help the vendor and evaluators identify&#xD;
    scripted areas being shown. The vendor will use these numbers as a reference, so the evaluators will know what function&#xD;
    is being demonstrated.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Include item descriptions that identify each function that is being scored. These descriptions are contained in the&#xD;
    Vendor and Package Evaluation Workshop Description and based on the critical use cases and critical nonfunctional&#xD;
    requirements. The listed item descriptions will ensure that an evaluator's score reflects how the demonstrated COTS&#xD;
    package supports these requirements.&#xD;
