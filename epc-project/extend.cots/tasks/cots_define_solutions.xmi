    &lt;strong>Note:&lt;/strong> Though this step is presented in a logical order, one might need to alternate between it and the&#xD;
    other 3 steps contained in this task or perform some of them in parallel.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This step is performed by doing a pair-wise comparison of the COTS packages identified in the context of the&#xD;
    marketplace sphere to the information gathered from the architecture and design sphere, stakeholder needs and business&#xD;
    processes sphere, and programmatics and risks sphere. The focus is on trying to understand where they match, where they&#xD;
    don't match, and a characterization of the mismatches.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The pair-wise comparison does not have to focus on all the spheres at the same time. For instance, the step could start&#xD;
    by comparing the identified COTS packages to the information gathered from the architecture and design sphere only, in&#xD;
    order to access how each COTS package fits into the enterprise architecture. Based on this information, some tradeoffs&#xD;
    could be negotiated and a solution formed. Then, the information gathered from the stakeholder needs and business&#xD;
    processes sphere could be added in order to assess how each COTS package supports the required user business processes.&#xD;
    Based on this information, some tradeoffs could be negotiated and the solution refined. This process&#xD;
    continues&amp;nbsp;until&amp;nbsp;the solution is formed based on all the available information gathered from the spheres.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This is a key step to make sure that any identified mismatch is understood and resolved. It is imperative to understand&#xD;
    how important each mismatch is to the solution and understand the possible ways the mismatch can be resolved.&#xD;
    Mismatches can be resolved through negotiating with stakeholders to modify user business processes and stated&#xD;
    stakeholder needs; gathering more information about the capabilities of the COTS packages and their ability to be&#xD;
    tailored to accommodate the mismatch; changing the way the architecture uses the COTS packages; or creating a custom&#xD;
    component to provide the necessary capability. If a mismatch cannot be sufficiently resolved, the candidate solution&#xD;
    can be removed from further consideration.&#xD;

    other 3 steps contained in this task or perform some of them in parallel.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    With an understanding of the matches and mismatches, a solution is formed (or updated) by assembling one or more COTS&#xD;
    packages or COTS package components, legacy systems (piece of the systems being replaced), reuse libraries, other reuse&#xD;
    sources (for example, freeware, shareware), any required custom code (including wrappers and &quot;glue&quot;) and appropriate&#xD;
    linkage to the broader organization's architecture with which the solution must interface. The solution architecture&#xD;
    and design is capture in the solution dossier.&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The objective of this step is to score the solution against the project's constraints, including the critical use cases&#xD;
    and the critical non-functional requirements, architectural and design constraints, project management constraints, and&#xD;
    any constraint related to business processes. The rating is done by using &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_requirements_attributes_EFE5ABAC.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{D0E2E7A1-4179-470E-AA18-419D5FEA275D}&quot;>Requirements Attributes&lt;/a>. Again, involving all stakeholders (or&#xD;
    empowered representatives) is highly recommended while performing this step in order to gather as much feedback as&#xD;
    possible on the candidate solution.&#xD;
