    The construction phase prepares the solution for fielding. It includes the preparation of the support strategy and&#xD;
    necessary support materials. It also includes the preparation of the user business environment of the target&#xD;
    organizations to facilitate the initial fielding of the solution. Furthermore, it includes the creation of a deployment&#xD;
    unit that consists of the software solution and necessary accompanying artifacts required to effectively install and&#xD;
    test the solution. Indeed, we recommend performing some acceptance testing of the solution in the construction phase to&#xD;
    make sure the solution is ready for the initial rollout that will take place in the first iterations of the transition&#xD;
    phase.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The important areas of work to prepare the solution for fielding are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Develop support strategy:&lt;/strong> The goal is to develop a support strategy for the solution. The&#xD;
        objective of the support strategy (documented in the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_deployment_plan_93F2F60B.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{993ED293-A529-4B3F-82CB-2BF289D9E4E4}&quot;>Deployment Plan&lt;/a>) is to help the users attain proficiency in the&#xD;
        solution and user business processes that the solution supports, as well as making sure the users are motivated to&#xD;
        use the solution and self-supporting in their use of the solution. As an example, a support strategy could be based&#xD;
        on a combination of instructor-led and web-based training, just-in-time mentoring, help desk and technical support,&#xD;
        as well as mechanisms to encourage the solution adoption like reward, incentive, and compensation programs. Any&#xD;
        support (such as training) necessary for acceptance testing and for the initial rollout of the solution need to be&#xD;
        provided to the users. It may be useful to separate the support needed for initial introduction from the long-term&#xD;
        support strategy. It is also important to ensure that the affected stakeholders agree that the support strategy&#xD;
        will meet their needs.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Develop support materials:&lt;/strong> The materials that assist the user in learning, using, operating and&#xD;
        maintaining the solution need to be designed (like &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_training_materials_AFBA1A46.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{F4612E56-C8DC-40AA-91C0-C6FA974D3D6E}&quot;>Training Materials&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_support_material_F6EEF661.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{84C28309-4BB7-4243-8760-1B40C537A175}&quot;>User Support Materials&lt;/a>). The materials necessary for acceptance&#xD;
        testing and for the initial rollout of the solution need to be developed. Training is an important component of the&#xD;
        support strategy. The training strategy has to accommodate many different stakeholder roles. It may be useful to&#xD;
        offer tailored training to specific categories of stakeholders. You may consider customizing the vendor's standard&#xD;
        training to the specific user business processes of the target organizations, or provide additional training to&#xD;
        complement the vendor's standard training.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Prepare deployment unit:&lt;/strong> The purpose is to prepare a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_deployment_unit_C9BAC05A.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{C5236E9F-6393-4CC8-992B-53BEBE651B9A}&quot;>Deployment Unit&lt;/a> that enables the solution to be effectively&#xD;
        installed, used, operated and maintained. A &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_deployment_unit_C9BAC05A.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{C5236E9F-6393-4CC8-992B-53BEBE651B9A}&quot;>Deployment Unit&lt;/a> consists of a production baseline &lt;a&#xD;
        class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_build_BA336272.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{53728CD9-FA47-4B58-A443-E9F9DC196916}&quot;>Build&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_training_materials_AFBA1A46.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{F4612E56-C8DC-40AA-91C0-C6FA974D3D6E}&quot;>Training Materials&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;

        guid=&quot;{84C28309-4BB7-4243-8760-1B40C537A175}&quot;>User Support Materials&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_release_notes_2B70FF3.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{1CF06B21-7D33-4255-8023-F6CE900FAD3A}&quot;>Release Notes&lt;/a>, &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_installation_artifacts_E94FBEC3.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{4F1EEC88-18C7-49F0-B441-4DC7DBFA8364}&quot;>Installation Artifacts&lt;/a> and &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_release_notes_2B70FF3.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{1CF06B21-7D33-4255-8023-F6CE900FAD3A}&quot;>Release Notes&lt;/a>.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Implement needed changes to the user's business processes:&lt;/strong> As the production-quality release is&#xD;
        being assembled in the construction phase, the users must prepare to implement the changes to the user's business&#xD;
        processes associated with the solution. This is particularly true for the users involved in acceptance testing as&#xD;
        well as for those affected by the initial rollout of the solution that will take place in the first iterations of&#xD;
        the transition phase. This is done by implementing the appropriate elements of the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
        href=&quot;./../../extend.cots/workproducts/cots_business_process_cm_plan_7172FCA3.html&quot;&#xD;
        guid=&quot;{D75AF5A7-8E32-4F53-89ED-E4BB101BB527}&quot;>Business Process Change Management Plan&lt;/a>. For instance, this&#xD;
        involves restructuring the organization as necessary and developing new policies and procedures to support the&#xD;
        solution.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;strong>Perform acceptance testing:&lt;/strong> Acceptance testing is the final test action before fielding the&#xD;
        solution. It can be performed with different levels of formality (&lt;strong>formal acceptance&lt;/strong>,&#xD;
        &lt;strong>informal acceptance&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>alpha test&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>beta test&lt;/strong>) depending on&#xD;
        organizational and corporate standards as well as application domains. The goal is to ensure that the solution is&#xD;
        deemed acceptable to the users prior to its general fielding. This is done by soliciting feedback on the solution&#xD;
        from a subset of the intended users while it is still under active development. The objective in the construction&#xD;
        phase is to verify that the executing system supports the needed changes to the user's business processes&#xD;
        associated with the solution, validate that the solution meets real needs and operates in an acceptable manner as&#xD;
        well as verify that the solution is ready for use by users: software solution integrated on the appropriate&#xD;
        platforms, current release described and changes to the user's business processes implemented. The goal is also to&#xD;
        make sure that existing defects and pending changes are not obstacles to achieving the purpose of the next release.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ul>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Preparing the solution for fielding is done by performing the following RUP tasks (note that other RUP tasks and&#xD;
    artifacts may be applicable, but this is the minimum recommended set):&#xD;
