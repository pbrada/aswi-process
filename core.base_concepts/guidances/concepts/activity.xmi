    Activities are the fundamental concept for defining processes.&amp;nbsp; Activities define the breakdown as well as flow of&#xD;
    work.&amp;nbsp; In other words, Activities can be nested into each other defining a breakdown structure of work or they can&#xD;
    define predecessor relationships to other Activities defining a flow presented in Activity diagrams.&amp;nbsp; Activities&#xD;
    can also contain references to Task, Roles, and Work Products called &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_5V9HEBUEEdqrUt4zetC1gg&quot;>Descriptor&lt;/a>.&amp;nbsp; Activities as well as Descriptors relate to timelines by allowing&#xD;
    their instances to define start and/or end dates.&amp;nbsp; Further, they specify information relevant to the instantiation&#xD;
    of work in project such as if an Activity shall be performed several times and if so if they can be performed in&#xD;
    parallel (hasMultipleOccurrences attribute) or one after other (isRepeatable attribute).&amp;nbsp; Activities and Task&#xD;
    Descriptors can also be event driven or describing ongoing work that does not have a fixed start and end time.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    UMA defines several&amp;nbsp;special Activities that allow expressing processes with terms many users are familiar&#xD;
    with.&amp;nbsp; For example, Phase or Iteration are just special Activities for which specific attribute values have been&#xD;
    set with predefined values. A process such as a &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;1.7072348895114264E-305&quot;>Capability Pattern&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;or &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;

    guid=&quot;_EhgqwO8MEdmKSqa_gSYthg&quot;>Delivery Process&lt;/a>&amp;nbsp;is also nothing else than just a special Activity that&#xD;
    contains additional documentation on why and how to use the process. Hence, because Activities could be nested into&#xD;
    each other, so can processes.&#xD;
