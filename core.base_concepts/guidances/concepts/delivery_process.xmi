    A Delivery Process is a special &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_concepts/guidances/termdefinitions/process_68E308B4.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;_yQ5m2NnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA&quot;>process&lt;/a> describing a complete and integrated approach for performing a specific&#xD;
    project type. &lt;!--StartFragment-->It provides a complete lifecycle model that has been detailed by sequencing Method&#xD;
    Content in breakdown structures. It describes a complete project lifecycle end-to-end and is used as a reference for&#xD;
    running projects with similar characteristics.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A&amp;nbsp;process engineer can define alternative Delivery Processes for software development projects that differ in the&#xD;
    scale of the engagement and staffing necessary, the type of the software application to be developed, the development&#xD;
    methods and technologies to be used, etc. Although, the Delivery Process aims to cover a whole project it keeps certain&#xD;
    decision that are too project specific open.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;For example, the breakdown structure defines which Breakdown&#xD;
    Elements have multiple occurrences or are repeatable via its specific attributes, but does not say how many occurrences&#xD;
    and how many repeats/iterations it will have.&amp;nbsp; These decisions have to be done by a project manager when planning&#xD;
    a concrete project, project phase, or project iterations.&lt;!--EndFragment-->&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;

&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In software engineering, the goal is to build a software product or to enhance an existing one. The Delivery Process&#xD;
    for software could be an iterative process, where the product is built incrementally over time, or it could be a&#xD;
    traditional waterfall Delivery Process in which all requirements are specified up front, followed by design,&#xD;
    implementation, and test phases.&#xD;
