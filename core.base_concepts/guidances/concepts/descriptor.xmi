  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Descriptor represent an occurrence of one concrete Content Element (such as Task, Role, Work Product) in an Activity.&#xD;
    Descriptors provides a proxy-like representation for these Content Elements within breakdown structures. In addition to&#xD;
    just referencing Content Elements it allows overriding the Content Elements' structural relationships by defining its&#xD;
    own sets of associations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Descriptors are a key concept for realizing the separation of Processes from Method Content. A Descriptor can be&#xD;
    characterized as a reference object for one particular Content Element, which has its own relationships and properties.&#xD;
    When a Descriptor is created, it has the same relationships as the referenced Content Element. However, users can&#xD;
    modify these relationships for the particular process situation for which the Descriptor has been created. The&#xD;
    Descriptor concept allows defining new relationships and specific process related properties. Descriptors are not&#xD;
    Content Elements and do not contain their own full descriptions. They refer or trace back to the Content Elements they&#xD;
    are based on instead.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

     The above illustration depicts an example using the UML 2.0 profile representation for UMA&amp;nbsp;in which Descriptors&#xD;
    have been created for a Task, its performing Roles, as well as its input/output Work Products. The situation implied by&#xD;
    this example is that the Task &quot;Prioritize Use Cases&quot; is to be performed differently in a project's Inception phase than&#xD;
    in its Elaboration phase. (that is, with different emphasis on different Steps, utilizing different inputs, etc.). In&#xD;
    particular, we can observe the following:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        The Task in Inception has an additional assisting Role (Customer.Project Manager) and does not provide a&#xD;
        relationship to the Risk List Work Product that had been defined as an optional input in the Method Content (that&#xD;
        is, Steps of the Task that work with the Risk List will be omitted in this phase).&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Two different types of Use Case Model Work Products are distinguished here: a Use Case Model as it is normally&#xD;
        being used during Inception, which describes use cases only briefly, versus use cases that have been detailed as it&#xD;
        is the case during the Elaboration phase.&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
