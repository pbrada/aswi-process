&lt;p>&#xD;
    A Discipline is a collection of Tasks that are related to a major &quot;area of concern&quot; within the overall project. The&#xD;
    grouping of Tasks into Disciplines is mainly an aid to understanding the project from a traditional waterfall&#xD;
    perspective. Although it is more common to perform Tasks concurrently across several Disciplines (for example, certain&#xD;
    requirements Tasks are performed in close coordination with analysis and design Tasks), separating these Tasks into&#xD;
    distinct Disciplines is simply an effective way to organize content, which makes comprehension easier.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Another reason that several Tasks are all categorized by the same Discipline is that they all represent a part in&#xD;
    achieving a higher goal or performing work that is all related to each other.&amp;nbsp; Every Discipline defines standard&#xD;
    ways of doing the work it categorizes.&amp;nbsp; Such standard ways are expressed by so-called reference workflows&#xD;
    described with &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_concepts/guidances/concepts/capability_pattern_ECA78A86.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;1.7072348895114264E-305&quot;>Capability Pattern&lt;/a>s defining how the Tasks categorized by the Discipline 'work&#xD;
    together' in the most generic way.&amp;nbsp; These reference workflows are often used for educating and teaching&#xD;
    practitioners.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Like other workflows, a Discipline's reference workflow is a semi-ordered sequence of activities presented as either a&#xD;
    breakdown structure or an activity diagram performed to achieve a particular result. The &quot;semi-ordered&quot; nature of&#xD;
    Discipline workflows emphasizes that the Discipline workflows cannot present the real nuances of scheduling &quot;real&#xD;
    work&quot;, for they cannot depict the optionality of activities or iterative nature of real projects. Yet they still have&#xD;
    value as a way for us to understand the process by breaking it into smaller areas of concern.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Example: The role of Disciplines in Software Engineering&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    In Software Development, each Discipline has associated with it one or more 'models', which are in turn composed of&#xD;
    associated Work Products. Some fundamental disciplines identified in Software are:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ul>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Business Modeling&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Requirements&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Analysis and Design&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Implementation&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Test&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Deployment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Configuration and Change Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Project Management&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        Environment&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
