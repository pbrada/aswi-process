    A release can be internal or external. An internal release is used only by the development organization, as part of a&#xD;
    milestone, or for a demonstration to users or customers. An external release (or delivery) is delivered to users. A&#xD;
    release is not necessarily a complete product, but can just be one step along the way, with its usefulness measured&#xD;
    only from an engineering perspective. Releases act as a forcing function that drives the development team to get&#xD;
    closure at regular intervals, avoiding the &quot;90% done, 90% remaining&quot; syndrome.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

    specialties in the team: designers, testers, writers, and so forth. Regular releases let you break down the integration&#xD;
    and test issues and spread them across the development cycle. These issues have often been the downfall of large&#xD;
    projects because all problems were discovered at once during the single massive integration step, which occurred very&#xD;
    late in the cycle, and where a single problem halts the whole team.&#xD;

    Work Product&lt;/a>s&amp;nbsp;are updated. It is said that this is a bit like &quot;growing&quot; software. Instead of developing Work&#xD;
    Products one after another, in a pipeline fashion, they are evolving across the cycle, although at different rates.&#xD;
