    &lt;a id=&quot;What is an iteration&quot; name=&quot;What is an iteration&quot;>What is an Iteration?&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    An iteration encompasses the development activities that lead to a product &lt;b>release&lt;/b>-a stable, executable version&#xD;
    of the product, together with any other peripheral elements necessary to use this release. So a development iteration&#xD;
    is in some sense one complete pass through all the disciplines: Requirements, Analysis &amp;amp; Design, Implementation,&#xD;
    and Test, at least. It is like a small waterfall project in itself. Note that evaluation criteria are established when&#xD;
    each iteration is planned. The release will have planned capability which is demonstrable. The duration of an iteration&#xD;
    will vary depending on the size and nature of the project, but it is likely that &lt;b>multiple&lt;/b> &lt;a&#xD;
    class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_build_BA336272.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{53728CD9-FA47-4B58-A443-E9F9DC196916}&quot;>builds&lt;/a> will be constructed in &lt;b>each&lt;/b> iteration, as specified in&#xD;
    the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLink&quot; href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/workproducts/rup_integration_build_plan_31CE4B79.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;{FA56B557-857D-4122-8E60-7A4A84418EB1}&quot;>Integration Build Plan&lt;/a> for the iteration. This is a consequence of&#xD;
    the continuous integration approach recommended in the Rational Unified Process (RUP): as unit-tested components become&#xD;
    available, they are integrated, then a build is produced and subjected to integration testing. In this way, the&#xD;
    capability of the integrated software grows as the iteration proceeds, towards the goals set when the iteration was&#xD;
    planned. It could be argued that each build itself represents a mini-iteration, the difference is in the planning&#xD;
    required and the formality of the assessment performed. It may be appropriate and convenient in some projects to&#xD;
    construct builds on a daily basis, but these would not represent iterations as the RUP defines them-except perhaps for&#xD;
    a very small, single person project. Even for small multi-person projects (for example, involving five people building&#xD;
    10,000 lines of code), it would be very difficult to achieve an iteration duration of less than a week. For an&#xD;
    explanation of why, see &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithType&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_rup/guidances/guidelines/software_development_plan_D687ED97.html&quot;&#xD;
    guid=&quot;1.6567134597638413E-305&quot;>Guideline: Software Development Plan&lt;/a>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&lt;!--EndFragment-->&#xD;
&lt;h3>&#xD;
    &lt;a id=&quot;Why iterate&quot; name=&quot;Why iterate&quot;>Why Iterate?&lt;/a>&#xD;
&lt;/h3>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Traditionally, projects have been organized to go through each discipline in sequence, once and only once. This leads&#xD;
    to the &lt;b>waterfall&lt;/b> lifecycle:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;86&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram show one iteration going from Business Modeling to Deployment&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;resources/waterfall.gif&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    This often results in an integration 'pile-up' late in implementation when, for the first time, the product is built&#xD;
    and testing begins. Problems which have remained hidden throughout Analysis, Design and Implementation come boiling to&#xD;
    the surface, and the project grinds to a halt as a lengthy bug-fix cycle begins.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    A more flexible (and less risky) way to proceed is to go several times through the various development disciplines,&#xD;
    building a better understanding of the requirements, engineering a robust architecture, ramping up the development&#xD;
    organization, and eventually delivering a series of implementations that are gradually more complete. This is called an&#xD;
    &lt;b>iterative&lt;/b> lifecycle. Each pass through the sequence of process disciplines is called an &lt;b>iteration&lt;/b>.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;img height=&quot;211&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram shows 3 successive iterations, each one going from Business Modeling to Deployment.&quot;&#xD;
    src=&quot;resources/iterative.gif&quot; width=&quot;431&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Therefore, from a development perspective the software lifecycle is a succession of &lt;b>iterations&lt;/b>, through which&#xD;
    the software develops incrementally. Each iteration concludes with the &lt;b>release&lt;/b> of an executable product. This&#xD;
    product may be a subset of the complete vision, but useful from some engineering or user perspective. Each release is&#xD;
    accompanied by supporting work products: release description, user documentation, plans, and so on, and updated models&#xD;
    of the system.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main consequence of this iterative approach is that the &lt;a class=&quot;elementLinkWithUserText&quot;&#xD;
    href=&quot;./../../../core.base_concepts/guidances/concepts/work_product_18CEEF8D.html&quot; guid=&quot;4.804531471620803E-306&quot;>work&#xD;
    products&lt;/a>, described earlier, grow and mature over time, as shown in the following diagram.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p class=&quot;picturetext&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;>&#xD;
    Information set evolution over the development phases.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;h4>&#xD;
    Minor milestone&#xD;
&lt;/h4>&#xD;
&lt;p>&#xD;
    Each iteration is concluded by a minor milestone, where the result of the iteration is assessed relative to the&#xD;
    objective success criteria of that particular iteration.&#xD;
